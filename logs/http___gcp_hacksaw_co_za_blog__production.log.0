It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, symbols, ideograms, logograms, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode.

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode.

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc\\n\\n\\nWhy use font files, Google fonts, when they could be in unicode?\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127.

They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. It’s just floating in heaven:\\n\\nA\\n\\nThis platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and A and A. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n\\nEvery platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n\\n\\nWhy use font files, Google fonts, when they could be in unicode?\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and A and A. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n\\nEvery platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041.

They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n\\nEvery platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n\\n\\nWhy use font files, Google fonts, when they could be in unicode?\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n\\n\\nWhy use font files, Google fonts, when they could be in unicode?\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, \\n\\n\\nWhy use font files, Google fonts, when they could be in unicode?\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041.

You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that....:\\n\\nThis Ghost blog, using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that....:\\n\\n[My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n\\nMedium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that....:\\n\\n* [My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n* Medium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n\\nSo for my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n\\nOn my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n\\nFor my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that....:\\n\\n* [My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n* Medium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n* For my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n* On my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n* For my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that....:\\n\\n* [My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n* Medium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n* For my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n* On my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n* For my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\\n\\n\\nThanks for listening!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that...., here is what I am using now:\\n\\n* [My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n* Medium.com now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n* For my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n* On my mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n* For my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beatiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\\n\\n\\nThanks for listening!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

It can be in the form of a tail, sharp or blunt, decorative or plain\\\", hence it being an oldy-looking font. Classical examples are Times New Roman\\n* On the other hand, Sans Serif, lack those funny extenders (hence the word \\\"sans\\\") and are cleaner, more modern looking fonts. Since 2007, Microsoft replaced [Times New Roman and Arial with Calibri](https://www.quora.com/Microsoft-Office/Why-did-Microsoft-change-the-default-font-to-Calibri), hence it being such a common font.\\n* There are more catergories of fonts, one being [geometric](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year)\\n* Of the [most recent popular fonts](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year), we see Helvetica and Proxima Nova\\n* Helvetica is actually quite old, being released in 1957, compared to Arial (1982) and Calibri (2007). Times New Roman dates back to 1932.\\n* For the history of fonts, check out the technical differences between 'typeface' and 'font'\\n* [This](http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html) is a nice listings of fonts, compatibilites and history\\n\\n##Influence\\n\\nConsidering how digital typefaces came about, their use was influenced by desktop computers, and specifically Operating Systems that chose certain fonts.

Kinda similiar to how [Windows images where bought and made famous](https://petapixel.com/2017/06/28/photographers-peeved-pics-quietly-used-windows-10/).\\n\\nIn the desktop world, one the biggest issues was compatbility. So since fonts need to be either shipped ot installed in the OS, and if you had a document that used a font that was not installed on  another PC, it would then be rendered using another font. Some document types that embed the fonts, like PDF,  help to prevent this. In the mobile world, they too influenced fonts and their usage, like Android's [Roboto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto).\\n\\n##Web fonts\\n\\nThen as the Web emerged, there came the issue of [font compatibilty on web sites](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/what-are-web-fonts-and-why-are-they-important/). There are issues of browser, and desktop vs mobile compatibilty. To help solve this, there are places that hosts fonts, like Google Fonts, that can be specified in your CSS.\\n\\nThere is also a more recent way to use [System Fonts for mobile web designs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/) - the fonts that are part of the mobile UI OS, like Roboto on Android\\n\\n\\n##Costs\\n\\nA lot of fonts [are'nt free](https://blog.typekit.com/2009/06/11/when-free-fonts-arent-free/). They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n![fonts-tech](/blog/content/images/2018/03/fonts-tech.png)\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*. The idea that A in a Times New Roman font is the same character as the A in a Helvetica font, but different from “a” in lower case, does not seem very controversial, but in some languages just figuring out what a letter is can cause controversy. Is the German letter ß a real letter or just a fancy way of writing ss? If a letter’s shape changes at the end of the word, is that a different letter? Hebrew says yes, Arabic says no. Anyway, the smart people at the Unicode consortium have been figuring this out for the last decade or so, accompanied by a great deal of highly political debate, and you don’t have to worry about it. They’ve figured it all out already.\\n* Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point. The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP or visiting the Unicode web site.\\n* Encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-8, was another system for storing your string of Unicode code points, those magic U+ numbers, in memory using 8 bit bytes.\\n\\n\\n##My fonts\\n\\nSo after all that...., here is what I am using now:\\n\\n* [My Ghost blog](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/ghost), using the default casper theme, uses fonts from Google Fonts.\\n* [Medium](https://medium.com/@jojo786/a-brief-tour-of-fonts-ee3b55c5869c) now [uses Charter (serif) and Kievit (sans serif)](https://medium.design/cast-of-characters-17eaa82755cf) for the body, and [system fonts for the interface](https://medium.design/project-tnt-4b9b4ea97cda).\\n* For my email on Mac, I switched over to Century Gothic.\\n* On my Mac, I also changed the [terminal font to Menlo](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070)\\n* For my arabic writing, I changed over to the [Uthmaan Taha font](https://forum.fontlab.com/other-topics/uthman-taha's-bold-naskh-font-releasedfree/), that I usually type with [Katib](https://katibapp.com/), a beautiful markdown app, with right-to-left auto detection.\\n\\n\\nThanks for listening!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"I recently changed came across the awesome worlds of fonts, because I got tired\nof the default font in my email-client .

Of the ones that I have seen around, nothing grabs me, or excites me. Most of the laptops I have seen lately in meeting rooms include the usual suspects: Dell, Acer, Lenovo. They all look boring - the same thing I've been using for the last few years. Thats nothing that inspires you, something akin to a new cell phone.</p>\n<p>I've briefly considered getting a laptop/tablet combo, something like the Samsung Ativ. But I am not sure if I will quickly get over the novelty of the touch screen. Then the only thing I will be stuck with is Windows 8.</p>\n<p>So I am really thinking about getting either a Macbook Pro, or Macbook Air. The new Macbook Pro's come with Retina display, but the Airs had the SSD. The other possible factors are the lack of DVD drive on the Air (have not used a CD/DVD this year), and a few other things. What really has driven me towards Mac is that I will have a shell easily accessible. Parellels or some other virtulasation software will allow me to run Windows apps (Visio and Project) and Ubunutu in a VM, without having to dual boot.</p>\n<p>I have never used an Apple product before, so thats what makes me uncertain. For that last 3 years, I have been using a Lenovo R400 - a 14.1 inch Dual Core sorry excuse for laptop. Performance is dreadfull - Visio and Excel open together is enough to make the machine hang.</p>\n<p>Prior to that, I used a HP 17 inch laptop for about 3 years. I was generally impressed with it. But that was 2009 - I doubt a heavy laptop, with lots of USB ports and a DVD writer is what I am looking for now.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> what I want is something light, with a decent screen (15&quot;) and lots of power, and a shell closeby. Ubuntu is not ready for enterprise use full time, so thats why perhaps Mac sounds like a good choice.</p>\n<p>Whatddya think?</p>\n<p>November 2017 update - after almost 4 years, my <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/sp691?locale=en_ZA\">MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)</a> with 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM and SSD is still going strong.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/im-thinking-of-going-mac/","comment_id":"18"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/im-thinking-of-going-mac/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"41ab-e0yKVgeLxWTo/cPRJoSMgtIHz54\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"40ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-03-04T23:10:38.455Z","v":0}
