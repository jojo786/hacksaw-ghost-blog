If nothing is required, kill that alert: rather under-alert than over-alert.</p>\n<p>Alerts should <em>not go to email</em>. Email is too slow, and out-of-band. Send alerts to the standby guys IM (Telegram, Slack) via bots, or use <a href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/\">PagerDuty</a></p>\n<p>For an Engineer on call/standby, this is crucial. He needs to know what needs to be done, and where to look for more info, and quickly (<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-normal-working-day-for-a-software-engineer-in-Silicon-Valley-like\">this guy has to respond to pagers with-in 5 mins</a>).

If it becomes too full it could cause system instability as new files will not be able to be created and current files will not be written to.\nProvide clear steps to resolve the problem, or link to a run book. Alerts with neither of these things are useless.#\n✘ Fix it by deleting stuff.\n✓ Follow the run book here for identifying and resolving disk space issues: https://example.com/runbook/disk.

You then installed the OS, DB and applications, and had to maintain that.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtualised</strong>: We then started to virtualise that, but you still had to build your own infrastrcuture of servers, hypervisors, storage and networking, before you get to running your OS in a VM. And you had to keep maintain, upgrade and support that stack, together with the OS, DB and app.</li>\n<li><strong>Converged</strong>: We then decided to buy pre-built Converged Infrastructure (vBlocks, Flexpods) that was the same stack as above, but pre-built in factory, which saved you a good few months of building it yourself, but then you still had to maintain and support it.</li>\n<li><strong>Initial Cloud</strong>: Perhaps then you decided to go a Cloud platform (GCP, Azure, AWS, IBM Bluemix), and create a VM there. This is not yet true cloud - you might not have to maintain the hardware stack, but you still need to maintain the stack above it: OS, DB, and application</li>\n<li><strong>True Cloud</strong>: you go to a Cloud Platform, and just give them you code to run, using <a href=\"https://cloudacademy.com/blog/microsoft-azure-functions-vs-google-cloud-functions-fight-for-serverless-cloud-domination-continues/\">Cloud Functions</a>, and you select a DB (SQl, NoSQL, Hadoop).

Of the ones that I have seen around, nothing grabs me, or excites me. Most of the laptops I have seen lately in meeting rooms include the usual suspects: Dell, Acer, Lenovo. They all look boring - the same thing I've been using for the last few years. Thats nothing that inspires you, something akin to a new cell phone.</p>\n<p>I've briefly considered getting a laptop/tablet combo, something like the Samsung Ativ. But I am not sure if I will quickly get over the novelty of the touch screen. Then the only thing I will be stuck with is Windows 8.</p>\n<p>So I am really thinking about getting either a Macbook Pro, or Macbook Air. The new Macbook Pro's come with Retina display, but the Airs had the SSD. The other possible factors are the lack of DVD drive on the Air (have not used a CD/DVD this year), and a few other things. What really has driven me towards Mac is that I will have a shell easily accessible. Parellels or some other virtulasation software will allow me to run Windows apps (Visio and Project) and Ubunutu in a VM, without having to dual boot.</p>\n<p>I have never used an Apple product before, so thats what makes me uncertain. For that last 3 years, I have been using a Lenovo R400 - a 14.1 inch Dual Core sorry excuse for laptop. Performance is dreadfull - Visio and Excel open together is enough to make the machine hang.</p>\n<p>Prior to that, I used a HP 17 inch laptop for about 3 years. I was generally impressed with it. But that was 2009 - I doubt a heavy laptop, with lots of USB ports and a DVD writer is what I am looking for now.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> what I want is something light, with a decent screen (15&quot;) and lots of power, and a shell closeby. Ubuntu is not ready for enterprise use full time, so thats why perhaps Mac sounds like a good choice.</p>\n<p>Whatddya think?</p>\n<p>November 2017 update - after almost 4 years, my <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/sp691?locale=en_ZA\">MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)</a> with 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8GB RAM and SSD is still going strong.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/im-thinking-of-going-mac/","comment_id":"18"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/im-thinking-of-going-mac/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"41ab-e0yKVgeLxWTo/cPRJoSMgtIHz54\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"19ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-01-01T21:25:11.928Z","v":0}
