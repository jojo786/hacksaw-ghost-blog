But to really see how useful it is, lets see how it fits into the bigger picture. This is my desktop at the moment:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2017/10/2013-09-27-Desktop-laptop-setup.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>MacBook Pro 13&quot; (Previously HP XPS 13'' laptop - Windows 7)<br>\nHP Pro Desktop PC - Ubuntu 14.04<br>\nSamsung 21.5'' LED monitor<br>\nLogitech MX mouse</p>\n<p>Both the laptop and the desktop are connected to the big screen - one via VGA, the other via DVI.  I use the one mouse and keyboard to control both environments, using Synergy.  Most of the time, Ubuntu is on the big screen. However, if I need to use the big screen for Windows as an extended desktop, I can quickly switch the screen from the VGA to the DVI input.</p>\n<p>I keep files in sync between Windows and Linux using Unison. This is a two way sync, allowing both the environments to see my latest file changes. Between the MacBook Pro and Linux I use BitTorrent Sync, which is a private Dropbox replacement. I also setup TimeMachine on the MBP to backup to an external HDD plugged into Linux.</p>\n<p>This is pretty much an almost exact copy of the desktop setup I used about 4 years ago. I dont know how long I will be using this setup though - I might soon switch to using a Mac. Maybe one day when I grow up, perhaps I can get a 27'' iMac, which one of the guys here uses.</p>\n<p>Update 2017: For the last 2.5 years, my current setup is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Pro 13&quot;</li>\n<li>HP Desktop PC with SSD - Hackintosh</li>\n<li>Samsung 27&quot; screen</li>\n<li>Logitech MX mouse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So with the Hackintosh, I basically built my own iMac with a large screen.</p>\n<p>I pay for 100GB Google Drive to sync files between the MBP and Hackintosh, and native Screen Sharing to control the Hackintosh on a separate window</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/desktop-setup/","comment_id":"27"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/desktop-setup/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"40ec-eXK4j/ogTHRIXlRz2l83lWucXcA\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"141ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T02:36:29.774Z","v":0}

The objective is to setup a audio streaming icecast source client (using darkice) that records to SD, using any network. User intervention not required other than plugging in power.</p>\n<p>I ordered from <a href=\"http://www.pifactory.co.za/\">http://www.pifactory.co.za/</a> and it got delivered two days later. A few other places I tried had run out of stock of the Model B, so I had to go with the B+. I have included the components that I bought at the bottom of this page, which in total came out to R1,233.48, which included R100 for delivery.<br>\nSeparately, I bought a USB sound card and 4GB SD card from Matrix Warehouse for R50 each.</p>\n<p>Summary of the steps I followed to do the setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write raspbian.img to the SD card from Mac using <a href=\"http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup\">http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup</a></li>\n<li>Plug in SD card and power. Figure out the DHCP address which the router assigned</li>\n<li>setup darkice using <a href=\"http://www.t3node.com/blog/live-streaming-mp3-audio-with-darkice-and-icecast2-on-raspberry-pi/\">http://www.t3node.com/blog/live-streaming-mp3-audio-with-darkice-and-icecast2-on-raspberry-pi/</a> and cron scripts (written by a friend)</li>\n<li>Setup WiFi using <a href=\"http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/raspberrypi_wifi.html\">http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/raspberrypi_wifi.html</a></li>\n<li>Plug in USB sound card - it just works</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So when it boots up, darkice connects automatically, and it records to SD. It can use ethernet or WiFi; I know need to setup connecting using a 3G USB dongle.<br>\nNext step, figure out how to use the On/Off switch using <a href=\"http://www.pi-supply.com/pi-supply-switch-v1-1-assembly-instructions/\">http://www.pi-supply.com/pi-supply-switch-v1-1-assembly-instructions/</a></p>\n<pre><code>1 x\tRASPBERY PI MODEL B+ - R445.00\nSKU: SC13456\n1 x\tRaspberry Pi Power Supply - R89.00\nSKU: PW03043\n1 x\tPi Supply Switch – On/Off Power Switch for Raspberry Pi - R189.00\nSKU: PSUSWITCH\n1 x\tB+ ENCLOSURE, RASPBERRY PI, BLACK - R99.00\nSKU: SC13460\n1 x\tMiniature WiFi (802.11b/g/n) Module: For Raspberry Pi and more - R160.00\nSKU: ADA814\n\n</code></pre>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/3-14159265359/","comment_id":"32"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/3-14159265359/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4219-zBTAlJ30jY3QZmnMHQeyPwfCoZk\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"31ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T02:36:32.270Z","v":0}

Because of the way I was indoctrinated early on in my career, I learnt that documents with fancy names meant that you were more mature in your process. Documents are meant to transfer information around between different people, departments and companies. Its meant to solidify and get agreement on specifications. There's different templates, formats, audiences...the whole deal.</p>\n<p>So early on I relished writing documents. I was told that it was important to document the requirements for a system, then document the design of a system after it was built, then document the ...... you get the message.<br>\nI then became a consultant, and documents were the measure of progress, and sometimes even the actual thing that we sold. I have worked on projects where for 3 months a team of us created a single power point deck.<br>\nIn the IT industry, documentation is the lingua franca, the currency of the day. Its what we trade in. &quot;I will send you the Technical Specification once you send me the Business Requirements&quot;. So we spend our day writing reams of documents, and project meetings ticking off the documents we have written. But there is one big problem with this whole process:</p>\n<p><strong>Nobody reads documents!</strong></p>\n<p>There, I said it! Nobody ever reads them, until the person has left the company and the next guy needs to the figure what has been done. This ignores the people who review documents just to nitpick the format, section placement, etc. But nobody reads documents to actually transfer knowledge, and get agreement on a project thats active.

Your company company offers training courses, and because there is dedicated budget for it, and because its part of your KPIs, you go on a course every year. Usually its a vendor related course, or maybe a TOGAF course here and there. But its boring, apart from the free lunch coupons. But how will that keep your skills relevant for the next 20 years? Can you afford to go (back) to university to (re) do your CS or Engineering degree?</p>\n<p>I have recently been blown away by the plethora of online training. This is not just CBT Nuggets (which was very good though, it helped me get by CCNA). I am talking about online learning that is two way, and customised and focussed for your specific area. Its as good, or maybe even better, than a good university degree. MooCs, and its variants, are changing the way we will learn.</p>\n<p>&quot;Well known MOOC providers include courses from: EDX, Coursera, Udacity and Khan Academy with content supplied by some of the leading universities and technology companies around the world such as MIT, Harvard, Berkerley, Stanford, Google, AT&amp;T and Facebook&quot;</p>\n<p>I recently took a MooC from Coursera for Web Application Architectures. It was a ahigh quality course. I watched the videos, completed the quizzes after each video, and then completed the assignments. Each contributed to the final mark. To make sure that I would dedicate myself over the 6 weeks, I paid for the Verified Certificate. It was worth it.</p>\n<p>The content from MooCs covers all learning subjects. I believe some content even tops University offered equivalents because of the real life applications, e.g. these Micro Degrees on Big Data: <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci\">https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci</a> and <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/15.071x_2/1T2015/info\">https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/15.071x_2/1T2015/info</a></p>\n<p>Regarding programming, I have come across some really cool places to learn how to code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.bloc.io/ultimate-guide-ruby-bootcamps/\">http://blog.bloc.io/ultimate-guide-ruby-bootcamps/</a><br>\nwatch coders line on TV: <a href=\"http://coderstv.com/\">http://coderstv.com/</a> and <a href=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/\">https://www.livecoding.tv/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/\">https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.howtocode.io/\">http://www.howtocode.io/</a></p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/new-age-of-learning/","comment_id":"45"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/new-age-of-learning/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4339-S0gAjIyCNIoDHs1Y74Ziw5QwHsI\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"42ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T03:06:24.031Z","v":0}

The problems with email are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asynchronous - in our world of real-time everything, is surprising that email has lasted so long.</li>\n<li>No built-in feedback: Receipts dont work. Because its async, people to resort to phoning or asking people if they received their mail. This is crazy. You never ask people if they received your whatsapp, because if gives you instant feedback with the ticks.</li>\n<li>Takes too long. People understand that email is send and wait, so they therefore build their workflow around that. You have to wait for a reply!</li>\n<li>Far too many - its too easy to CC as many people as possible. Its not focussed enough.</li>\n<li>The protocol is far too antiquated. Emails can get lost and not delivered.</li>\n<li>When a mail trail gets too long, its difficult to follow who said what. And the sad part is that all the signatures and headers take most of the space.</li>\n<li>Email is so clunky. Email feels to me how people <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-did-people-work-before-widespread-of-email\">behaved before email</a> - its almost as bad as sending physical mail. Its too slow, and it might not even get there. The answer may not be relevant if it arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At my workplace, we actively use Instant Messaging. No, not Lync! We use Telegram. Its realtime, and quick. Its perfect for most situations, especially:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when you actively working with someone on a problem. Because we have domain experts, if you putting in or supporting a problem, you need real time communication with others even if they based on the next floor, or another office some where else. Telegram makes it seem like the guy is next to you, its that quick.</li>\n<li>Rooms or groups, based on topic: easy to send info to a group of people. No need to CC!</li>\n<li>Apps for PC/Mac, mobile and web</li>\n<li>Easy to send files</li>\n<li>Parses and loads web links/URLs</li>\n<li>Can reply to or quote previous or specific messages</li>\n<li>It just feels better than email.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having said that, IM or Telegram is not perfect. There are definitely situations where you cant respond now, and need to come back to it. Because IM flows downwards like a list, that item is quickly lost. I often force myself not to read a particular Telegram group, because the last discussion had a point I needed to come back to. So now I have to forcefully disconnect from the discussion because otherwise I will lose the action point.</p>\n<p>Email is not dead, yet, but it definitely needs to evolve. It needs to be relevant</p>\n<p>A few years ago Google came out with Wave. I thought it was perfect. It added real-time capabilites to email. Looking back, it seems to be the perfect mix between the strengths of email and IM. Sadly, they cared too much about the technical prowess of the protocol than usability.</p>\n<p>We tried Slack a while ago, but it seems to suffer from the same weaknesses on IM and Telegram. There's just no way to mark a message as unread. Also, you need to keep on inviting people, which hampers its uptake in a large organisation. If there was a way to use it in greenfields company, where you not choosing between email and IM, then Slack may work.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/im-so-over-email/","comment_id":"46"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/im-so-over-email/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"46a1-lZKQ4MLLTsPlkDcn/J3TGLW3rK0\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"30ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T03:17:10.464Z","v":0}

Rather, the password is hashed together with other values, and then the server compares the hash to its own hash computation, to see if they are the same. If they are, then the device must have the correct password.</p>\n<p>When a device tries to REGISTER, the server will challenge it with a nonce. The nonce is a one-time key, meant to prevent replay attacks. The device then needs to compute with following:</p>\n<p><code>HA1 = MD5(“myusername:asterisk:password”) HA2 = MD5(“REGISTER:sip:sip.example.com”) response = MD5(HA1+”:40787c47:”+HA2);</code><br>\nThe device will send the response value to the server for comparison.</p>\n<p>In my case, to make sure that the hashes were computed correctly, I checked them like this:</p>\n<pre><code>yusufmayet@yusuf-HP-Desktop:~$ echo -n &quot;45345:realm.com:5435&quot; | md5sum\nd1c23d485345435e4c9c0bf63  -\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which gave me HA1</p>\n<pre><code>yusufmayet@yusuf-HP-Desktop:~$ echo -n &quot;REGISTER:sip:test.co.za:5060&quot; | md5sum\n4f20c9ab63453457e44696a3  -\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which gave me HA2</p>\n<pre><code>yusufmayet@yusuf-HP-Desktop:~$ echo -n &quot;d1c23d485345435e4c9c0bf63:2d6eb162513045769f23705546gf\n0000005297058d:4f20c9ab63453457e44696a3&quot; | md5sum\n\n2263f03dd182ff0c799c97a3c581e534  -\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which gave me response</p>\n<p>I could then compare the response values to make sure that it matches, and therefore the correct password was used.</p>\n<p>Another way it to this <a href=\"http://www.kapejod.org/en/2013/02/reversing-sip-digest-authentication-in-javascript-node-js/\">node application</a> to calculate the password, based on the above values. Once you have node.js installed, simply calling this app with node and the correct values, will generate the password. In my case, because the password contained numbers, I had to include numbers in the lower_case array in the application code.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/cracking-sip-digest-passwords/","comment_id":"28"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/cracking-sip-digest-passwords/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4271-12zMtrAM5HXF/6we/8K3O28O5Hw\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"39ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T04:16:46.796Z","v":0}

Sicne then, I have moved to mid-range phones, as the budget phones are just too slow.</p>\n<p>I have had an HTC Desire for about 3 and a half years. In July 2010, it initially came loaded with Android 2.1 (I seem to remember). About a year after that, I rooted with CyanogenMod Rom 7. However, I really missed the HTC Rosie dialler, which allowed to dial and search by name or number. So I put HTCs Sense back on, and thats pretty much how I kept it since then.</p>\n<p>Recently, the device has been rebooting when it gets hot (using GPS). It then could not boot, and I had to go into Recovery mode to restore an old backup of Sense. So it was time to look for a new device. But after 3 years, I was very happy with the HTC Desire.</p>\n<p>I was looking for a budget (read cheap) phone. Spending R6000 and above just for a phone seems ludicrous, especially since its bound to fall and get damaged. I also wanted a phone for my wife, so I needed two affordable phones.</p>\n<p>I had seen the Samsung Galaxy Pocket in Jet, Ackermans and other stores, for about R800. It ran Android 2.2, and seemed OK. However, I decided to get a Galaxy Pocket Plus - S5301. Dion Wired were selling it for about R900. It ran Android 4.0.4, on 4GB RAM with a 850 MHz CPU. Nothing special in terms of specs, but it had Android 4.x.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there are other cheaper, non-branded phones from China that have Android 4.x, but I did not see any. There is also a Huawei phone, but I think it was more expensive.</p>\n<p>After having it for a few weeks, I don't have any complaints. Yes, it does lag sometimes, but that is to be expected considering the CPU (even the HTC Desire had a 1GHz CPU).  Most apps run on it, with a notable exception of Google Now (only &gt; 4.1). And I don't really take pictures, so I don't mind the camera.</p>\n<p>This is my first Samsung device, after a run of three HTCs in a row (TyTn II, G1, Desire). I can honestly say that HTC has a superior feel and experience to its devices. Samsung does not even offer a dialler like Rosie? I'm sure the HTC One range knocks the socks off the Galaxy S3/S4.</p>\n<p>EDIT:<br>\nA recent article highlighted the Vodafone Smart Mini, which has a 1GHz CPU and runs Android 4.1, for only R799.<br>\n<a href=\"http://mybroadband.co.za/news/gadgets/83723-vodafone-smart-mini-low-cost-smartphone-launched.html\">http://mybroadband.co.za/news/gadgets/83723-vodafone-smart-mini-low-cost-smartphone-launched.html</a></p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/best-budget-android-phone/","comment_id":"29"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/best-budget-android-phone/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"435c-Y99PeTloIijMyTH0cCDBkvT8lAA\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"42ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T05:31:58.822Z","v":0}

Its data, but lots of it, so you need special ways to deal with it. Big deal!</p>\n<p>But this article about how twitter processes large amounts of data really got me excited. This post too explains all the moving parts in big data, which I had no idea about before this (I heard about Hadoop once or twice)</p>\n<p>What made it more relevant for me was this article about how big data and this fancy-named software is actually used.  This is the best part:</p>\n<p>The data science team embeds itself with the product team and they work together to either prove out product managers’ hunches or build products around data scientists’ findings. In 2013, Garten said, developers should expect infrastructure that lets them prototype applications and test ideas in near real time. And even business managers need to see analytics as close to real time as possible so they can monitor how new applications are performing.<br>\nNow for the last few weeks I have been prattling along about relevance: may be even re-inventing yourself and learning new skills. So perhaps Big Data is a good thing to learn and get into. And its not only just whitepapers and vapourware - the industry has a real need for these skills.  The question is how long will a person with typical current skills, SQL in this case, be relevant in tech industry if these new Big Data systems are becoming more prevalent. Will a typical RDBMS and SQL become the next COBOL very soon?</p>\n<p>There is real world training as well from Udacity(Cloudera), Coursera and EDX to help a person build these skills while still in his old job.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/big-data-relevance/","comment_id":"42"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/big-data-relevance/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"3f95-DkBQGuUQirx8q7UYtoN1sgSmM4c\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"29ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T05:46:52.055Z","v":0}

Its just the layer between between the user and hardware, but it makes all the difference. Somehow it can take the same hardware, after upgrading to a new version or even new OS, and make it much more functional. That same piece of hardware, be it a PC, laptop, phone or tablet, is now much more usefull. For the majority of users, who are unaware of the OS, they just buy devices based on vendor, price, and functionality - and I am OK with that. But I want to make a point so let me waffle a bit.</p>\n<p>When I first started dabbling with PCs I had MS-DOS. I remember the excitement upgrading to MS-DOS 6.2, which had new features (its a long time ago, so this could be incorrect) like support for bigger RAM and HDD, HDD compression, and a whole bunch of other things. I even tried out IBM's version called PC-DOS, to try out their version of HDD compression to give you more space. Then Windows 95 came out and blue never looked better. But Windows has only had a few releases, so most users got used to the same functionality, even if they upgraded their hardware.</p>\n<p>When I eventually started using Linux (Red Hat first), we got used to always upgrading to the latest applications, especially when using repo's like yum and apt. We also enjoyed reading flame wars about the difference between macro and micro kernels. When Ubuntu came out with their bi-annual release plan, we always had to look forward to two 'new' OSs per year.</p>\n<p>By and large, the average user mostly used Windows. He did not even know it was an Operating System, he just knew it was 'part of the computer'. Its worth adding that there was some users who used Apple Mac products - but they were always a bit strange. And perhaps the same thing with feature phones: even though certain vendors (Nokia, Motorola, Samsung) used the same OS (Symbian), users just bought phones based on the vendor, and did not even know it ran the same OS.</p>\n<p>Then things changed, just after Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. When Samsung and other vendors started making Android phones, then people started buying phones based on Operating System.  Now this seemed quite strange - why would a user choose an expensive piece of hardware based on the OS? The OS is just meant to be the layer on top of the hardware! Its a bunch of drivers and kernels and stuff.</p>\n<p>But perhaps this is where the real fun, innovation and features lie. People choose a phone because it has more/better apps that run on it. The majority of people cant tinker and innovate on hardware, but every developer can innovate in the software space.</p>\n<p>Things have matured a bit since then. For the most part, people know the difference between an iPhone and an Android. But with-in the Androids, people actually now think of buying a Samsung or an LG. They stop seeing the OS.</p>\n<p>So where am I getting at? Finally the point! I think thats why I decided to buy a MacBook Pro for work use rather than a PC/Windows based laptop. OS X has some really awesome features, and a much more integrated environment. I know its the difference between owning the entire chain (like IOS) versus just the OS layer (like Android and Windows) which runs on any hardware. But still, it feels nicer when its all integrated. That is why I am quite excited about the new features of the soon-to-be released version of OS X 10.10.  It is very tightly integrated into the rest of the Apple eco-system. And this is the kicker for me:</p>\n<p>You can now answer and make calls from OS X if your iPhone is connected to the same WiFi network. You can send SMS from the Mac, and transfer work between devices, and switch on the iPhone's Hotspot.</p>\n<p>Now I know Android is tightly integrated into the Google eco-system, and thats what I love about it. Google Maps, Gmail, G+, all synced, history across devices all synced. Brilliant.  (I'm an Android user since 2008 using a G1, if you want to check my cred). But to enable Android to share links with your PC using Chrome, you have to install Google Chrome to Phone on both PC and Android. I know there are other apps to allow the PC to control and Android, and even to send SMS and make calls from the PC. But they all require separate apps. And maybe thats my point - they should be part of the stock-standard OS.</p>\n<p>But I doubt I will get an iPhone. For one,  I cant afford an expensive phone - thats why I use a budget phone.  And I need widgets.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/synergy-between-devices-without-apps/","comment_id":"31"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/synergy-between-devices-without-apps/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4bd6-hMokLPsp5g8GQgEQu88YCzOF7tM\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"24ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T06:51:17.707Z","v":0}

I had to complete an evaluation form, where you rate yourself on programming languages, systems, experience in specific industried. In Google style, a rating of 10 applies only if you have written a book on that subject.</li>\n<li>2 March 2011: 30 minutes telephonic interview with HR person. He had a list of multiple choice questions. It included things like &quot;what is the command to rename a file on Linux&quot; and some other Java and TCP/IP questions</li>\n<li>9 March: 1 hour telephonic interview with a Technical Account Manager from the UK. This was a standard type of interview. Interesting questions were stuff like &quot;what do you think of Android&quot; and &quot;what can Google do in Africa&quot;. I think one of the questions, either in this interview, or one of the other ones, was &quot;what happens when I type a website name into the navigation bar and click enter&quot; - this entails a talk about DNS, IP, HTTP, etc. <a href=\"https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when\">Read this</a> for the answer</li>\n<li>26 May: four sets of interviews at the Google Johannesburg office. At the last minute, they asked me to do it over video conference from home, as their conferencing system  was down. I used Google Talk (now Hangouts) with each of the interviewers, with video and Google Docs sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last part was interesting. I was interviewed by 4 people, one at a time, 45 mins each, over video conference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical Account Manager) based in London</li>\n<li>(Tech Lead Manager) based in London (Technical Interview)</li>\n<li>(Sales Engineer/Technical Account Manager) based in London</li>\n<li>(Business Development Manager) based in Lagos (HR/Client facing skills interview)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were a few of the typical Google/Microsoft brain teasers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much will a Art Restorer earn - this went on for about 15 minutes</li>\n<li>How much will Google pay Dell to pre-install the Google Toolbar on new Dell PCs - this went on for about 20 to 30 mins</li>\n<li>What is the angle between the hour and minute hand at 3:15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The question where I really struggled was where I was asked to implement atoi (array to integer converter) in pseudo code. I had not coded for a few years, so this really threw me.

It took me quite some time to figure out what I wanted. I have been using a Dell XPS 13'', which is a nifty, good looking machine that performs very well. But it still Windows. And Ubuntu is not quite there yet as a full time desktop OS.</p>\n<p>I considered a few Apple options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>27'' iMac: I would have chosen this one, if not for the lack of a decent backup laptop, which would mean I lost all portability. 90% of the time I am at my desk, so this would have been ideal, as supposed to using a laptop with a large external screen</li>\n<li>MacBook Air: The entry price is quite good, but the specs are too low. If you bump the specs up to the maximum, then the cost of drastically prohibitive. I suppose such a small light body comes at a cost.</li>\n<li>Various MacBook Pros - 13'' and 15''. The late 2013 refresh models are quite good, but the Retina screens come at a cost. There are quite a few different options to consider when ordering: RAM, SSD or HDD size, CPU size - i7, Dual or Quad core.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, I chose a MacBook Pro 13'' with the following specs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>13.3 inch</li>\n<li>2.8 GHz i7 Dual Core</li>\n<li>8GB RAM</li>\n<li>256GB SSD<br>\nEven though I only got it this morning, in hind-sight I should have gotten 16GB RAM, even by downscaling the CPU a bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The comparative Dell XPS 13'' or even 15'' would have been cheaper, although I did not look at the touch screen versions.</p>\n<p>This is a very neat machine, and my first Apple product. I think its the small touches that Apple pay attention to that win people over. Some things are over done though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The clunky charger - c'mon, Chromebooks use USB now to charge</li>\n<li>The aluminium body - the Dell XPSs have a plastic body which is perfect. I have seen a guy that has a dent in his MacBook's body simply because he held it too tight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Multiple desktops have been setup, Hot Corners as well....now where is that right click?</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/how-do-i-right-click/","comment_id":"30"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/how-do-i-right-click/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4142-vXgO+2K13oZtoHE3f2HxTqH1OLk\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"25ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T08:21:53.468Z","v":0}

Since leaving campus, opportunities for formal studying and training have been difficult to come by. You have to have a plan, be dedicated, and make the time, while being sure to be fair and balance life, family and work.</p>\n<p>As I look back, I realise I should have studied more. Here is a quick look at what I have done so far:</p>\n<h1 id=\"20052007\">2005 - 2007</h1>\n<p>At ECN, I did no formal training. I suppose I was just happy to be finally done with exams after 15 years or so.</p>\n<h1 id=\"20082010\">2008 - 2010</h1>\n<p>Early in 2008 just after I joined, I decided I wanted to do more studying. I found out about a MSc Eng in Telecoms that Wits was offering. Some of the guys had completed while still at Wits before coming to work. I planned to complete it over 3 years. The first half of the year was for the course work and lectures, and the 2nd half of the year for research. I did two courses in 2008, and two courses in 2009. Each course lasted 6 weeks, with lectures of 3 hours, two days a week. I used to wake up at 3am to study, come in to work at 7am, leave for lectures at 8:30, and come back at lunch, and stay till late. 3 hour exam at the end of each course! When I told my manager that I was going to make up for all the lost work he said &quot;I dont care what hours you do, just finish the work&quot;. Awesome!!! After 2 years of studying most weekends, I gave up. Best decision I made, with absolutely no regrets. Family is more important than this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the same time at MTN, I did a one day Time Management course offered off-site. I still remember some of the things I learned, and have been practicing on it.</li>\n<li>I also did a one-week F5 BigIP Load-Balancer support engineer course</li>\n<li>Ericsson GSM one-week course</li>\n<li>SmartTrust DP support engineer one week course</li>\n<li>I was scheduled for an Oracle DB one-week course, but my resignation meant I could not make it</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"20112013\">2011 - 2013</h1>\n<p>Two major training events at Accenture. Core Consulting School in Chicago in March 2011 - this is one of mandatory schools. They teach the Accenture methodology, primarily for Project Management and client interaction. Very good learning experience - about 300 similar skilled people from all over the world for a week.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The other major one was Technology Architecture school in London. Very awesome learning experience</li>\n<li>TMForum training - one week</li>\n<li>I also self-studied towards Cisco CCNA1 in May 2011, and CCNA2 during July 2011. In December 2011 and January 2012, I self-studied CCDA</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"20132015\">2013 - 2015</h1>\n<p>During December 2013 at IS I self-studied SIP School SSCA</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal CCNA SP 1 training for a week, and the exam the next week.</li>\n<li>During December 2014 / January 2015, self studied EMC Information and Storage Management. Exam coming soon I hope</li>\n<li>I also did a on-line VCE Associate course with exam, that took about 6 hours in December</li>\n<li>I hope to do a VMWare course and Exam this year, as well as complete CCNA SP 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Update 2017:</p>\n<h1 id=\"2016\">2016</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Redhat</li>\n<li>LEAP: Ken Blanchard Leadership</li>\n<li>Design Thinking: IDEA</li>\n<li>Crucial Conversations</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"2017\">2017</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Crucial Accountability</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/learning-and-training/","comment_id":"38"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/learning-and-training/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"46dc-u+ulnG/FYHDm2ch/p1O9AhLaSZM\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"29ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T09:37:10.789Z","v":0}

Promise.</p>\n<p>In my previous post, I highlighted that the main problem I have with the Hiring process is that it is too slow. Its almost designed to make sure that the company will frustrate candidates, and that the candidate that eventually made it through to the end of the process simply had no other alternatives.</p>\n<p>The other issues are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>candidates only get to see the financials right at the end. You go through the whole process only to find out they cannot afford you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>working for a company is not a marriage. I've read too many posts that when people resign, the assumption is that they have somehow broken &quot;the trust&quot;. Nonsense - working is purely a business agreement, with benefit to both sides. The company gets its work done, and the candidate gets a salary. If I were a millionaire, I would not be working.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could not have said it better <a href=\"http://qr.ae/Dhujo\">than this post on Quora</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In most cases the mistake is the interview itself. In all its clever variations, the interview is a terrible way to determine if a candidate could be of value to a business.<br>\nI think it filters out good talent more than it finds. Human nature is to game the interviewee. Even very novel selection strategies by Fortune 500 companies are vigorously scrutinized by candidates in an effort to cheat them.<br>\nTake for example the infamous Stryker Gallup test and interview process.

It was young, and even for the layman, fairly easy to get into. You could easily build up skills, and make a name for your self. Even without a degree, there are many courses, and guys (mostly) got jobs. Our generation replaced the 'main-frame' guys - we used our Java to mock their COBOL,  as we showed them Linux running on our laptops that blew their mind.</p>\n<p>But after 10 years now, I can see the 'gotchas'.  There is no &quot;science&quot; to IT. It changes far too fast to mature. And thats the double-edged sword of IT - low barrier to entry as supposed to medicine or engineering, but because it changes so fast, we are becoming quickly out-dated. Not because we don't have the desire and capability to learn and up-skill, but because we will miss the next big mind-shift, and we won't be fast enough to catch up. The next generation will take our combined learnings as innate and obvious and basic, and will define new architectures that we just won't 'GET'.</p>\n<p>They say that Computer Science is about learning fundamentals, that can be applied in other areas. Degrees (Engineering, Computer Science, etc) is more about learning how to learn, then learning any language or system in particular. Its about the basic building blocks of Operating Systems, and databases, and other stuff. They should be able to re-learn and re-invent themselves as systems and tools change. But I argue that in 20 years or less, most of those building blocks (data structures, CPUs, networks) will be so vastly changed, that they wont apply any more. They will be so far abstracted away by new languages and frameworks, that you wont even have to think about DNS and IP any more, it will just be assumed. So all those things that we are so particular about when designing systems, like High Availability, Modularity and so forth, will be 'built-in' to the new building blocks of the future, rendering our past experiences and knowledge as null and void.</p>\n<p>The people of a few hundred years ago had to primarily worry about food and heat. Those were their basic building blocks of their life. Nowadays, food and heat are just assumed to be there. We can get it with no effort - its included in everything we know and see. So if a person of the past appeared in this day, his complete life of experiences built around learning how to hunt, and how to generate fire, is completely useless. In the same way, as the building blocks of IT change, at some point, it will render past generations (us) irrelevant.</p>\n<p>I think thats the key thought: relevance! Will the skills that we have built now, still be relevant in 20 years time. For a doctor and engineer, as he ages, he just gets better at what he does. For guys in IT, change and time is the killer.</p>\n<p>It would be interesting to track how a doctor who qualified ten years, would continue to earn over the next fifty years, compared to an IT-skilled person.</p>\n<p>Some interesting posts I came across:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-exist-in-10-years-that-dont-exist-now-and-how-do-I-prepare-to-qualify-for-them\">http://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-exist-in-10-years-that-dont-exist-now-and-how-do-I-prepare-to-qualify-for-them</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Will-a-degree-in-computer-science-still-be-in-demand-50+-years-from-today\">http://www.quora.com/Will-a-degree-in-computer-science-still-be-in-demand-50+-years-from-today</a></p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/relevance/","comment_id":"39"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/relevance/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"463f-MfgumzeC2ilvezks2WbOxhWCEqU\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"25ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T14:21:29.564Z","v":0}

This is a 24x7 job, on call/standby, and you have KPIs/SLAs of 99.9xx% uptime - <a href=\"http://www.longpelaexpertise.com.au/ezine/FiveNinesAvailability.php\">five 9s</a> means <em>only</em> 5 minutes per year downtime. Which means that you need to have eyes and ears on every layer in that stack, that constantly monitor and alert you when things go wrong.</p>\n<p>So when starting to building your alerting strategy, first read <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/master/content/docs/practices/alerting.md\">My Philosophy on Alerting</a>, which mentions things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>keep alerting simple,</li>\n<li>alert on symptoms,</li>\n<li>have good consoles to allow pinpointing causes,</li>\n<li>and avoid having pages where there is nothing to do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Golden Rule:</strong> Alerts <em>must</em> be actionable - which means every alert must result in someone doing something.

Alerts that dont need action, or too many alerts, will lead to burn-out and real alerts being ignored.</p>\n<pre><code>We have a set of guidelines for the content of alerts, which all our alerts should follow,\nMake the title/summary descriptive and concise.#\n✘ ALERT: Something went wrong.\n✓ Disk is 80% full on prod-web-loadbalancer-af5462ce.\nMake sure to include the metric which triggered the alert somewhere in the body.#\n✘ Diskspace on a disk is filling.\n✓ avg(last_1h):max:system.disk.in_use{env:prod-web-loadbalancer} by {host} &gt; 0.8\nThe body should also include a description of what the actual problem is, and why it's an issue.#\n✘ Disk is full.\n✓ The disk on this host is at 80% capacity.

I finally decided to upgrade to ghost v1 (1.18 at time of writing). Ghost 1.x is described as a major upgrade, with many breaking changes.

With docker, I mounted the config directory from the host, which had the blog data and theme. The theme had broken (due to major version changes), and I could not get blog to come up. But the ain issue was that the config file had changed, and ghost was not reading it, and since I dont ghost as the main domain, but hanging off /blog, all the links were broken.</p>\n<p>After struggling for a good few days, I finally got it to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thiswashowiusedtoruntheghostdockercontainer\">This was how I used to run the ghost docker container:</h2>\n<pre><code>docker run -d -p 4431:2368 --restart-always -v /home/yusufm/gitwork/ghost-data:/var/lib/ghost ghost\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this is how I run it now:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -d --name ghost-v1-13 -p 4431:2368 --restart always -v /home/yusufm/gitwork/ghost-data-v1:/var/lib/ghost/content -e url=http://gcp.hacksaw.co.za/blog/ ghost\n</code></pre>\n<p>which looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>yusufm@hacksaw-1:~/gitwork$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES\n132bf4c26c5e        ghost               &quot;docker-entrypoint...&quot;   5 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:4431-&gt;2368/tcp   ghost-v1-13\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main changes are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/var/lib/ghost</code> has changed to <code>/var/lib/ghost/content</code></li>\n<li>using environment variables to specifu the URL, which is required if you have a subdomain or part after the main domain name, like <code>/blog</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Btw, I now use <code>--name</code> to specify the container name, rather than an auto-generated random container name</p>\n<p>These were very helpfull posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://daten-und-bass.io/blog/migrating-to-ghost-1-x-with-docker/\">https://daten-und-bass.io/blog/migrating-to-ghost-1-x-with-docker/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/93\">https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/93</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/\">https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thisistheprocessiusedtorunthenewghostversion118\">This is the process I used to run the new ghost version 1.18:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Export your data from the v0 ghost.

Recently, I even have the word 'product' in my job title. It basically involves helping companies develop and build new services, offerings and products, that they sell to their customers. It requires understanding the market, what customers want, what they need, what they pay, what competitors offer. My specific responsibility in this development cycle is the technical architecture of the product.<br>\nAll in all, product development comes down to two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build the correct products</li>\n<li>Build products correctly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 2nd one is where I/we normally focus. It includes the Technical Architecture, and focusses on building systems that are scalable, extendable, flexible and performant. We know how to do these things.</p>\n<p>But what about the 1st one: making sure you actually building what the market and customers want and need? This usually involves a business case - that shows the need for the product, and what its returns will be. But this step (from my experience) is mostly superficial - its glossed over, and does not contain enough market and customer research. Usually this is because this product was promised by someone high up, or its a me-too product, and come what may, it will be developed and launched.</p>\n<p>I always hear people complain about the lack of customer and market research. In some cases, if the company is really trying to be innovative, there might not be any research around. But in most cases, there should be data that can be gathered to shape the new product. I believe only a few market leaders  (e.g. Apple) exist that can invent new products, and the market will follow. I recently read about MicroStrategy, that was chosen to be amongst the top 50 companies in their ability to read the market. This leads to really cutting edge product development, and involves quite a large amount of risk I would imagine.</p>\n<p>When companies are building new products, they have a budget, and they want the returns to be maximised. So they try to choose a product that will lead to the greatest return, based on the investment. It might not be the most snazzy or flashy product, but as long as it can promise good returns, it will be a good investment. Its like a small store or shop owner: if he is thinking of what additional merchandise to stock in this shop, he will choose something that is likely to sell well, and that is within his budget.</p>\n<p>So the question is how do companies gather sufficient data and requirements to build new products:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Where does requirements for products come from?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How do companies know which products to launch?<br>\nThese might be done in using different ways, sometimes employing many techniques at the same time, in different departments:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Research and Development departments - they might consider risky and future based technologies and products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incubation divisions - these might be used to venture into new markets, and building completely new capabilities that the company does not have.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I imagine that even with these there is quite a high hit-and-miss ratio.  And because of changing markets and economics, things that made sense last year all of a sudden dont make any sense this year. Think of Mxit not being able to deal with the coming of smartphones. Heck - atleast Duke Nukem Forever got released.</p>\n<p>I am still quite struck by an experience a few years ago. Two large mobile operators, at roughly the same time, launched a feature phone IM application. They both chose the same vendor. Less than 3 years later, both products were decommissioned as failures.  That means both sets of operators got the research wrong, both went down the same path, and both failed. Clever people in both companies wrote business cases, that got approved by even more clever people. And they all got it wrong. Wow....product development is hard!</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":{"id":"1","name":"Yusuf Mayet","slug":"yusuf","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eef09804da833671b2bed1d449e3497?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"tags":{},"primary_tag":null,"url":"/2017/10/28/building-the-right-products/","comment_id":"43"},"_locals":{"version":"1.18.0","safeVersion":"1.18","relativeUrl":"/2017/10/28/building-the-right-products/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"1574381c0b33"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4a1d-nplRgR1YAZr7HWsein/9o2sb7rU\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"33ms"},"msg":"","time":"2017-12-17T17:12:09.697Z","v":0}

Recently it has just been limited to pulling in a WSDL in java to test how the SOAP API works. I tried my hand at Android development a few years back. But the one place that I never really dabbled in was the web. I did help to maintain a few JSP pages a few years ago,  but I barely knew what I was doing. And with the rise of responsive websites, I have always regretted not knowing anything about HTML, CSS, javascript and web frameworks.</p>\n<p>In my pursuit of relevance, I recently took a MooC course about Web Application Architectures: <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/webapplications-003/quiz\">https://class.coursera.org/webapplications-003/quiz</a></p>\n<p>It explains MVC, HTTP and a bunch of related concepts, using Ruby on Rails as the tool.

Curiously, 24/7 shifts are not the problem. The real\\nproblem is small on-call rotations that result in long, frequent\\nshifts. The more time people spend on-call, the more likely they\\nare to suffer from depression and anxiety [7]. The expectation of\\nhaving to act is more stressful than acting itself [8]. It’s one thing\\nto accept that on-call is part of a job. It’s another to tell your fiveyear-old\\ndaughter you can’t bring her to the playground.\\n````\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"plaintext":"As a follup to my previous post regarding Monitoring and Alerting in Operations\n[https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/12/07/alerting-monitoring-and-dashboards/]\n, we discuss\nPsychological Safety in Operation Teams:\nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_winter17_09_looney.pdf\n\nhttps://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/being-on-call.html\n\nhttps://github.com/alicegoldfuss/oncall-handbook\n\nPagerDuty\n\nAlert dashboard for Prometheus Alertmanager: https://github.com/cloudflare/unsee\n\nYusuf Mayet, [01.08.17 08:32]\nthis was shared earlier as well: \nhttps://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/promoting-reliability-in-web-software-companies\n\nYusuf Mayet, [01.08.17 08:52]\nalso a good read: https://response.pagerduty.com/\n\nYusuf Mayet, [01.08.17 08:32]\nthis was shared earlier as well: \nhttps://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/promoting-reliability-in-web-software-companies\n\nYusuf Mayet, [01.08.17 08:52]\nalso a good read: https://response.pagerduty.com/\n\nYusuf Mayet, [01.08.17 08:56]\nWe have a set of guidelines for the content of alerts, which all our alerts\nshould follow,\nMake the title/summary descriptive and concise.#\n✘ ALERT: Something went wrong.\n✓ Disk is 80% full on prod-web-loadbalancer-af5462ce.\nMake sure to include the metric which triggered the alert somewhere in the\nbody.#\n✘ Diskspace on a disk is filling.\n✓ avg(last_1h):max:system.disk.in_use{env:prod-web-loadbalancer} by {host} > 0.8\nThe body should also include a description of what the actual problem is, and\nwhy it's an issue.#\n✘ Disk is full.\n✓ The disk on this host is at 80% capacity.
