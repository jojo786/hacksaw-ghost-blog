Hence the need to understand your target system to choose the correct configs\\n\\n#Getting Started\\nI initially started with [with this link](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-8560w-to-install-guide-and-clover.162641/), which led me to [this](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-hp-probook-elitebook-zbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch-10-11.189416/), [that one](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/hp-probook-installer-clover-edition.128774/#post1007032), [another one](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-to-install-yosemite-on-hp-laptops-with-clover-uefi.143675/).\\n\\nIn the end, I went with these two:\\n\\n- [an overview](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-hp-probook-elitebook-zbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch-10-11.189416/) and\\n- [the details](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/) \\n\\nwhich is much more hands-on, as supposed to what I have previusly done, using Multibeast and Unibeast.\\n\\nThe above is using the Clover bootloader.

This post is about how to get Mac OS X El Capitane 10.11.4\nrunning on a HP Elitebook 8560w laptop.\n\nHopefully, this will be written like these high-class tutorials:\n\nLaptop Specs - Overview\nThe detailed specs are too long to put upfront, so please refer to the output of\nthe commands in the Detailed section.\nIts important to know the main components of the target machine, as that\ndictates what configs we will use, as dicussed in this link\n[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/]\n\nFor our purposes, the main details are this laptop is:\n\n * HP EliteBook 8560w\n * CPU: i7-2670QM\n * Graphics card: nVidia Quadro 1000M\n * Screen resolution: 1920x1080 LCD\n\nThis main tutorial page\n[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/] \n is primarily for Intel HD integrated/built-in/onboard graphics cards, and not\nthe dedicated/discrete nVidia Quadro 1000M that I have. Hence the need to\nunderstand your target system to choose the correct configs\n\nGetting Started\nI initially started with with this link\n[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-8560w-to-install-guide-and-clover.162641/]\n, which led me to this\n[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-hp-probook-elitebook-zbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch-10-11.189416/]\n, that one, another one\n[https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-to-install-yosemite-on-hp-laptops-with-clover-uefi.143675/]\n.\n\nIn the end, I went with these two:\n\n * an overview\n   [https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-hp-probook-elitebook-zbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch-10-11.189416/] \n    and\n * the details\n   [https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/]\n\nwhich is much more hands-on, as supposed to what I have previusly done, using\nMultibeast and Unibeast.\n\nThe above is using the Clover bootloader. Another different option is to use\nChameleon: \nhttp://forum.osxlatitude.com/index.php?/topic/6536-hp-elitebook-8560w-with-i7-2630qm-nvidia-quadro-1000m-and-1920x1080-lcd-mavericks/\n\nThese are also good reads:\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/faq-read-first-laptop-frequent-questions.164990/\n\nsound and graphics\nIn the end, I had a booting OS X, but graphics was stuck to 1024X768, and not\nworking sound.\n\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/read-me-first-graphics-setup-troubleshooting.183617/\n\nhttps://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/mavericks-10-9-3-on-hp-elitebook-8560w.133033/\n\nLaptop Specs - Detailed\nOk, lets start with the specs of this laptop, using the commands lshw and lspci,\nfrom the Ubuntu, the previous OS it had prior to installing OS X:\n\n ─[yusufm@yusufm-HP-EliteBook-8560w] - [~] - [Sun Apr 16, 21:52]\n└─[$] <> sudo lshw\n\nyusufm-hp-elitebook-8560w   \ndescription: Notebook\nproduct: HP EliteBook 8560w (LY524EA#ACQ)\nvendor: Hewlett-Packard\nversion: A0001D02\nserial: 5CB2350LSY\nwidth: 64 bits\ncapabilities: smbios-2.6 dmi-2.6 smp vsyscall32\nconfiguration: boot=normal chassis=notebook family=103C_5336AN sku=LY524EA#ACQ uuid=B8F73CB4-35F4-E111-A257-A891E502A0A8\n *-core\n   description: Motherboard\n   product: 1631\n   vendor: Hewlett-Packard\n   physical id: 0\n   version: KBC Version 01.3F\n   serial: PCDJKB97V3E09M\n *-firmware\n      description: BIOS\n      vendor: Hewlett-Packard\n      physical id: c\n      version: 68SVD Ver.

I seen an advert in the Star Workplace (a physical printed newspaper - not very startup-y) looking for a Java Developer. The location was Fordsburg, the home of spicy Indian food, eating out for every single mean, the Plaza, and other unhealty things.

A new industry was starting up in SA, as VoIP was just legalised in Feb 2005, and new companies were forming to take advantage of it. Larger companies also moved in, like Internet Solutions with the VoIS solution.\\n\\nIn the end, I worked there 3 years. The founder, lets call him John, was a former banker and entrepreneur, and had owned and successfully sold his two previous companies.

I did the billing completely by myself for the 1st 1.5 years. At the end of the first 3 months, with no product ready, and no revenue expected, they retrenched two developers. A few months later, the two CTO bothers left, leaving us technically with a leader. I became the stand-in, and took up all the Linux sysadmin, networking, development of the voice product, and customer installations. I basically did everything (besides development of the CRM, which was left to the other devs) - which was a wonderful way to learn. I googled, used Linux User Groups and pretty much everything to figure things out.\\n\\nJohn quickly became an industry leader, advocating with the regulators for opening up of the networks. When mobile interconnects opened up, we where the first VANS to get SS7 interconnects with Vodacom, MTN and Telkom.\\n\\nWe took on our first customer, and kept them, despite failures, and the learnings from it. They were our guinea pigs. We changed tech very often, ad used bleeding edge software and hardware:\\n+ Asterisk was brand new to us, and the rest of SA. \\n+ We started with modems to do mobile voice over SIMs, then moved to SIM banks, then PCI based cards with SIMs. The driver was still in development by a European dev who was sponsored to do the dev, and I used to send crash dumps to him to fix.\\n+ We hired a European freelancing developer off some forum to add more codec support to a softphone, that we eventually never sold to any customer\\n+ I was given an SS7 book a few days before to learn it so we could interconnect with Telkom. I was still reading the book as we drove to Vodacoms office to discuss the SS7 agreement. The open source SS7 drivers were still in development, and once we failed the ATP tests, we quickly bought some dedicated hardware to do the SS7 part for us.\\n\\nAs I look back, I'm shocked at how 'cowboy' we where. We ran most of the core voice traffic through a single server in a single DC, with no redundancy, HA, backup or anything of the sort. We were figuring things out in production. We would often 'quickly restart' the core voice switch and drop hundreds of active voice calls during the day, to fix stuff.\\n\\nWe grew quickly. We made our first 'experienced hire' at the end of the first year. The rest of the next few hires were my friends from campus. Some smart guys - Linux kernel devs. We then approached our lecturer from campus, who joined and became our manager and CTO (and still works there to this day).\\nWe eventually moved out of Fordsburg to a fancy plush office in Rosebank.\\n\\nI left after three years.

I seen an\nadvert in the Star Workplace (a physical printed newspaper - not very startup-y)\nlooking for a Java Developer. The location was Fordsburg, the home of spicy\nIndian food, eating out for every single mean, the Plaza, and other unhealty\nthings. The founding place of a million rand company.\n\nThe interview went well. It was for a new company that was starting - they were\nhiring 6 new Java devs, and I was the 6th and last hire. A new industry was\nstarting up in SA, as VoIP was just legalised in Feb 2005, and new companies\nwere forming to take advantage of it. Larger companies also moved in, like\nInternet Solutions with the VoIS solution.\n\nIn the end, I worked there 3 years. The founder, lets call him John, was a\nformer banker and entrepreneur, and had owned and successfully sold his two\nprevious companies. He was on the lookout for a new venture, and came across the\nlegalisation of VoIP. With no former experience, he decided to dive in. He\nfinanced everything for the first 2 years. He partnered up with a two brothers,\nwho served as a CTO of sorts.\n\nI started out doing Java Development, working on the billing and CRM modules. I\ndid the billing completely by myself for the 1st 1.5 years. At the end of the\nfirst 3 months, with no product ready, and no revenue expected, they retrenched\ntwo developers. A few months later, the two CTO bothers left, leaving us\ntechnically with a leader. I became the stand-in, and took up all the Linux\nsysadmin, networking, development of the voice product, and customer\ninstallations. I basically did everything (besides development of the CRM, which\nwas left to the other devs) - which was a wonderful way to learn.

Perhaps too often. But I know enough of the job finding and hiring process to know that it is broken, and desperately needs fixing. This post is a pet peeve, that's been brewing for a number of years. My biggest gripe is that it takes far too long, for both sides:\\nFor the potential employee, it takes a minimum of two months.\\nFor the employer, its at least double that.\\n\\nThe basics of the hiring process is as follows:\\n\\nA department in Company A realises it is taking strain - the workload is too much for the current amount of staff. Most of the time it is purely reactive like when there has been some turnover of current staff, or possibly sometimes there is demand planning done at the start of the financial year, or when a new strategy or operating model is released.\\nDepartment looks at its budget, and realises it can hire x amount of people, at y (junior, middle management, senior) different levels. They agree this with HR.\\nThe hiring manager writes up the specs of the positions. Most of the time he copies it from the spec that currently exist (maybe from the spec that was published when they hired him 10 years), and modifies it a bit. It contains heavy company lingo, with some industry nomenclature. If he has the time, he might Google a bit to see what everybody is using to hire.\\nThe job spec gets sent to HR. Some review takes place, approvals, and sign-offs.\\nHR release the spec on their internal job board, and maybe concurrently on their external job portal, and to any recruitment agencies that they normally use (about five). A closing date is set about three weeks in the future\\nAfter the closing date, there are about two hundred applications. HR easily dispose of most of them, either by guessing, key work scanning, and just plain luck.\\nAbout ten CV's/applications are sent to the hiring manager. He selects about five to interview. HR contacts them to set up interviews, or asks the recruitment agencies to contact the applications. Since the recruitment agency is a just a delayed man-in-the-middle, this will take atleast a week.\\nDepending on Companies A recruitment policies, there will be about two to four rounds of interviews, with these stakeholders: HR, hiring manager, co-workers, senior manager and finally with an executive/partner. It will consist of standard HR questions (tell me about your greatest weakness), technical questions (tell me what happens when you click search on google), psychometric tests, brain teasers (why is a manhole cover round) or just plain ludicrous (hands candidate a rubik's cube, holds a timer, and says \\\"GO!\\\")\\nEach round of interview needs to be scheduled (1 week)\\nConduct all interviews with the five candidates (2 weeks)\\nReview each candidate with go/no-go (2 weeks)\\nRinse and repeat for each round\\n\\nAfter the final round, you have a one or two candidates left. You make an offer to the best one.\\nOnly now does the candidate get to see the financials. If he accepts, he starts to serve his notice period. If he rejects, you hopefully have the other candidate waiting.\\nNotice/resignation period can be anything from 30 days to a calender month (which could last almost two months)\\n\\nIn South Africa, a large consulting firm (which globally hires 60K people annually) realised that it needs to double its workforce by 2015. Thats not even taking into account doing work offshore / near shore and bringing in cheaper labour (thats the Indians!). An expert recruiter told them that the SA workforce simply cannot support and deliver that amount of candidates. Considering that other companies are also increasing the workforce (except for Cell C still handing out letters), the demand is not sustainable. Add BEE, ridiculous recruitment times, un-managed resignations - and you can see that the situation is even worse. \\n\\nPersonally, I've found jobs via both recruitment agencies and direct applications. In 2005 I responded to a job post in The Star newspaper via fax (old school), twice via recruitment agencies, and recently via LinkedIn.  My recent experience lasted 7 months: I went for my first interview in November, and I start the new job in June.  Most of the times I had received multiple offers, so I had the luxury of choosing the best. The longer the recruiting process, the bigger the potential to lose good talent to the competition. Thats why its even more important for companies to implement a more agile way of recruitment, to ensure that they can effectively compete in the job market. In some cases, if I was lucky to get my timing correctly, at the end of the process I had two or more offers to choose from. And in some cases, I had to accept an offer from one company, while the other companies offer came a week later, and I had to politely let them down.\\n\\nWe need more that just [LinkedIn Recruit](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2013/04/10/who-should-you-hire-linkedin-says-try-our-algorithm/) or Stackoverflow Careers. We need more that just better tools - what we really need is a culture and mindset change. Companies cannot simply rely on their popularity and size in order to attract talent - they need to actively seek it out. They need to understand that talent is a scarce resource, and they are operating in a competitive environment. For every person that is invited for an interview at Company A, he is probably also going through the recruitment process at two or three other companies. Considering that SA is an emerging market, the demand in IT, (specifically in the Communications and Technology industries) is more than the supply pool can handle. Companies need to actively source talent in a fast and efficient way. But perhaps the biggest thing that holds them back, is the risk. The risk of making the wrong decision and hiring the wrong guy.  But even now, with the three to seven rounds of interviews that candidates have to go through, the wrong guys still get hired. And its not about hiring a guy with the wrong skill set t. Its easy enough to weed out the [posers](http://thedailywtf.com/Series/Tales_from_the_Interview.aspx). What is harder is to find people with the same cultural fit, to make sure you don't hire a [manage-by-excel guy](http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/12/04/dilbert-on-excel/). And with South African labour law, its almost impossible to fire someone. So I get it: its difficult to find the right people. But surely the risk of being understaffed is greater, and every extra day that you take looking for good talent, you are losing them to other companies.\\n\\nThe long recruitment timeline needs to be drastically cut. I am suggesting a faster way of running the interviews: at the moment, candidates go back and forth for each round of interview. They attend interviews during their lunch breaks, or they might even take a half-day leave. Assuming that each company has three rounds of interviews, and that the candidate is being interviewed by at least three companies, thats atleast nine rounds of interviews that he will attend. From each companies perspective - if they start off with five candidates for round 1, three for round two, and 1 for the last round, thats 9 interviews that HR needs to schedule. Considering that you need open slots in the each stakeholders diary, and in each candidates diary, you can easily see why this takes at least a few months.\\n\\nWhat I am suggesting is a bit radical: we schedule ALL rounds with ALL candidates in a single day, or maybe even over a few days, but definitely within a week. At the end, you have a final list that you can make an offer to. Lets go through it:\\n\\nConsider Department B in Company A is hiring for a single position. After HR sifts through the initial applications, the hiring manager invites five people for interviews. (Important point: at this stage, the people that are invited to attend interviews are already potential candidates. That means you've already weeded out the obvious no-gos, and that the selected ones possess the required skills, experience, etc on their CVs. The interviews now are really to confirm what is on their CVs, and to ascertain the culture fit). The candidates are advised that they take leave for a whole day. This should be individual one-on-one interviews with each candidate, but it could also include grouping candidates together to make things go faster. HR then books the following on the scheduled day:\\n\\n* Half hour each interviews for all five candidates -  this will go from 8:00AM to 11:00AM. HR and the hiring manager sit in each interview, with 5 minutes in-between to review. There are only 3 choices to limit decision fatigue: Go, No-Go, Discuss.  \\n* 11:00AM to 11:30AM - go through the list to see who needs to be invited to the next round  \\n* 12:00PM to 3:00PM - the shortlisted get called back for the 2nd round individually, this time with the hiring manager, and possible team-members and/or a senior manager. This can be an hour long if required. Same 3 choices: Go, No-Go, Discuss    \\n* 3:00PM to 3:30PM - go through the list to whittle it down to the last two.\\n* 3:30PM to 4:30PM - Hiring Manager, HR and an Executive/partner interview the last two, for half hour each.  \\n* 4:30PM to 5:00PM - decide to make an offer to one candidate. The other is kept as backup, incase the first one rejects.\\n\\nThe above can perhaps be done over two days, if the list of initial candidates is large, perhaps with different groups on different days. The benefits of this technique is:\\n\\n* Its easier to book diaries. Only the hiring manager and HR are dedicated for the day, the rest come in when required.  \\n* The candidates don't need to drive back and forth for the different rounds.  \\n* And even if they attended two other companies interviews, they would only need three days of leave.  \\n* Most importantly, it cuts down on interview stress for the candidate. They can leave after the day with certainty, knowing that they made it through or not. Believe me, the biggest stress comes from playing the waiting game. A few times a company has got back to invite me for the next round after a month (including Google). The waiting severely limits your choices - you might accept an offer, not knowing if  another company might get back to you or not.  \\n* This way, the hiring manager can go home, knowing he has his man, in just ONE DAY. The confirming of the financials and acceptance will still take some time, but at least the final candidate knows what his options are.\\n\\n\\nNow this potentially poses a challenge to current recruitment agencies. But they can use this to their advantage  They can handle all of the scheduling of interviews with the candidates. They might even use their premises, which could be ideally set up to cater for enough seating and activities to keep candidates busy for the day. They could even make it into a [recruitment fair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_job_fair): by inviting a few companies to interview at the same time. The HR and hiring managers of each company could attend, choose which candidates they want to interview, and then make their decisions. Its fair game!\\n\\nI agree that this alone is not enough to change current conditions. We need better tools as well. Most companies use Taleo as their internal job board, which is ugly and difficult to use.

Perhaps too often. But I know enough of the job finding and hiring process to know that it is broken, and desperately needs fixing. This post is a pet peeve, that's been brewing for a number of years. My biggest gripe is that it takes far too long, for both sides:<br>\nFor the potential employee, it takes a minimum of two months.<br>\nFor the employer, its at least double that.</p>\n<p>The basics of the hiring process is as follows:</p>\n<p>A department in Company A realises it is taking strain - the workload is too much for the current amount of staff. Most of the time it is purely reactive like when there has been some turnover of current staff, or possibly sometimes there is demand planning done at the start of the financial year, or when a new strategy or operating model is released.<br>\nDepartment looks at its budget, and realises it can hire x amount of people, at y (junior, middle management, senior) different levels. They agree this with HR.<br>\nThe hiring manager writes up the specs of the positions. Most of the time he copies it from the spec that currently exist (maybe from the spec that was published when they hired him 10 years), and modifies it a bit. It contains heavy company lingo, with some industry nomenclature. If he has the time, he might Google a bit to see what everybody is using to hire.<br>\nThe job spec gets sent to HR. Some review takes place, approvals, and sign-offs.<br>\nHR release the spec on their internal job board, and maybe concurrently on their external job portal, and to any recruitment agencies that they normally use (about five). A closing date is set about three weeks in the future<br>\nAfter the closing date, there are about two hundred applications. HR easily dispose of most of them, either by guessing, key work scanning, and just plain luck.<br>\nAbout ten CV's/applications are sent to the hiring manager. He selects about five to interview. HR contacts them to set up interviews, or asks the recruitment agencies to contact the applications. Since the recruitment agency is a just a delayed man-in-the-middle, this will take atleast a week.<br>\nDepending on Companies A recruitment policies, there will be about two to four rounds of interviews, with these stakeholders: HR, hiring manager, co-workers, senior manager and finally with an executive/partner. It will consist of standard HR questions (tell me about your greatest weakness), technical questions (tell me what happens when you click search on google), psychometric tests, brain teasers (why is a manhole cover round) or just plain ludicrous (hands candidate a rubik's cube, holds a timer, and says &quot;GO!&quot;)<br>\nEach round of interview needs to be scheduled (1 week)<br>\nConduct all interviews with the five candidates (2 weeks)<br>\nReview each candidate with go/no-go (2 weeks)<br>\nRinse and repeat for each round</p>\n<p>After the final round, you have a one or two candidates left. You make an offer to the best one.<br>\nOnly now does the candidate get to see the financials. If he accepts, he starts to serve his notice period. If he rejects, you hopefully have the other candidate waiting.<br>\nNotice/resignation period can be anything from 30 days to a calender month (which could last almost two months)</p>\n<p>In South Africa, a large consulting firm (which globally hires 60K people annually) realised that it needs to double its workforce by 2015. Thats not even taking into account doing work offshore / near shore and bringing in cheaper labour (thats the Indians!). An expert recruiter told them that the SA workforce simply cannot support and deliver that amount of candidates. Considering that other companies are also increasing the workforce (except for Cell C still handing out letters), the demand is not sustainable. Add BEE, ridiculous recruitment times, un-managed resignations - and you can see that the situation is even worse.</p>\n<p>Personally, I've found jobs via both recruitment agencies and direct applications. In 2005 I responded to a job post in The Star newspaper via fax (old school), twice via recruitment agencies, and recently via LinkedIn.  My recent experience lasted 7 months: I went for my first interview in November, and I start the new job in June.  Most of the times I had received multiple offers, so I had the luxury of choosing the best. The longer the recruiting process, the bigger the potential to lose good talent to the competition. Thats why its even more important for companies to implement a more agile way of recruitment, to ensure that they can effectively compete in the job market. In some cases, if I was lucky to get my timing correctly, at the end of the process I had two or more offers to choose from. And in some cases, I had to accept an offer from one company, while the other companies offer came a week later, and I had to politely let them down.</p>\n<p>We need more that just <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2013/04/10/who-should-you-hire-linkedin-says-try-our-algorithm/\">LinkedIn Recruit</a> or Stackoverflow Careers. We need more that just better tools - what we really need is a culture and mindset change. Companies cannot simply rely on their popularity and size in order to attract talent - they need to actively seek it out. They need to understand that talent is a scarce resource, and they are operating in a competitive environment. For every person that is invited for an interview at Company A, he is probably also going through the recruitment process at two or three other companies. Considering that SA is an emerging market, the demand in IT, (specifically in the Communications and Technology industries) is more than the supply pool can handle. Companies need to actively source talent in a fast and efficient way. But perhaps the biggest thing that holds them back, is the risk. The risk of making the wrong decision and hiring the wrong guy.  But even now, with the three to seven rounds of interviews that candidates have to go through, the wrong guys still get hired. And its not about hiring a guy with the wrong skill set t. Its easy enough to weed out the <a href=\"http://thedailywtf.com/Series/Tales_from_the_Interview.aspx\">posers</a>. What is harder is to find people with the same cultural fit, to make sure you don't hire a <a href=\"http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/12/04/dilbert-on-excel/\">manage-by-excel guy</a>. And with South African labour law, its almost impossible to fire someone. So I get it: its difficult to find the right people. But surely the risk of being understaffed is greater, and every extra day that you take looking for good talent, you are losing them to other companies.</p>\n<p>The long recruitment timeline needs to be drastically cut. I am suggesting a faster way of running the interviews: at the moment, candidates go back and forth for each round of interview. They attend interviews during their lunch breaks, or they might even take a half-day leave. Assuming that each company has three rounds of interviews, and that the candidate is being interviewed by at least three companies, thats atleast nine rounds of interviews that he will attend. From each companies perspective - if they start off with five candidates for round 1, three for round two, and 1 for the last round, thats 9 interviews that HR needs to schedule. Considering that you need open slots in the each stakeholders diary, and in each candidates diary, you can easily see why this takes at least a few months.</p>\n<p>What I am suggesting is a bit radical: we schedule ALL rounds with ALL candidates in a single day, or maybe even over a few days, but definitely within a week. At the end, you have a final list that you can make an offer to. Lets go through it:</p>\n<p>Consider Department B in Company A is hiring for a single position. After HR sifts through the initial applications, the hiring manager invites five people for interviews. (Important point: at this stage, the people that are invited to attend interviews are already potential candidates. That means you've already weeded out the obvious no-gos, and that the selected ones possess the required skills, experience, etc on their CVs. The interviews now are really to confirm what is on their CVs, and to ascertain the culture fit). The candidates are advised that they take leave for a whole day. This should be individual one-on-one interviews with each candidate, but it could also include grouping candidates together to make things go faster. HR then books the following on the scheduled day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half hour each interviews for all five candidates -  this will go from 8:00AM to 11:00AM. HR and the hiring manager sit in each interview, with 5 minutes in-between to review. There are only 3 choices to limit decision fatigue: Go, No-Go, Discuss.</li>\n<li>11:00AM to 11:30AM - go through the list to see who needs to be invited to the next round</li>\n<li>12:00PM to 3:00PM - the shortlisted get called back for the 2nd round individually, this time with the hiring manager, and possible team-members and/or a senior manager. This can be an hour long if required. Same 3 choices: Go, No-Go, Discuss</li>\n<li>3:00PM to 3:30PM - go through the list to whittle it down to the last two.</li>\n<li>3:30PM to 4:30PM - Hiring Manager, HR and an Executive/partner interview the last two, for half hour each.</li>\n<li>4:30PM to 5:00PM - decide to make an offer to one candidate. The other is kept as backup, incase the first one rejects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above can perhaps be done over two days, if the list of initial candidates is large, perhaps with different groups on different days. The benefits of this technique is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its easier to book diaries. Only the hiring manager and HR are dedicated for the day, the rest come in when required.</li>\n<li>The candidates don't need to drive back and forth for the different rounds.</li>\n<li>And even if they attended two other companies interviews, they would only need three days of leave.</li>\n<li>Most importantly, it cuts down on interview stress for the candidate. They can leave after the day with certainty, knowing that they made it through or not. Believe me, the biggest stress comes from playing the waiting game. A few times a company has got back to invite me for the next round after a month (including Google). The waiting severely limits your choices - you might accept an offer, not knowing if  another company might get back to you or not.</li>\n<li>This way, the hiring manager can go home, knowing he has his man, in just ONE DAY. The confirming of the financials and acceptance will still take some time, but at least the final candidate knows what his options are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now this potentially poses a challenge to current recruitment agencies. But they can use this to their advantage  They can handle all of the scheduling of interviews with the candidates. They might even use their premises, which could be ideally set up to cater for enough seating and activities to keep candidates busy for the day. They could even make it into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_job_fair\">recruitment fair</a>: by inviting a few companies to interview at the same time. The HR and hiring managers of each company could attend, choose which candidates they want to interview, and then make their decisions. Its fair game!</p>\n<p>I agree that this alone is not enough to change current conditions. We need better tools as well. Most companies use Taleo as their internal job board, which is ugly and difficult to use. Candidates have to register their profiles on each companies site, and setup automatic notices or remember to check back often to see if there is an opening. LinkedIn has only partially solved this.

HR runs an annual Human Capital Assessment Survey that is web-based. Its quite boring, and and less than 50% of employees take the time to fill it out. This time, they did something different. About 10 of us were invited to a meeting with a Senior Executive (now called Managing Directors) and HR. They wanted to find out if we had any burning issues that needs addressing.\\n\\nIt was a 3 step process:\\n\\n* We were given four sticky notes. On each, we had to write any issue that we wanted to bring to HR's attention. One issue per sticky note, all anonymous. These were then stuck onto the glass wall. Issues that commonly came up were: no work/life balance, lack of training, etc. HR then went through all of them, and arranged them in lines, grouping similar related issues. E.g. all of the training related issues were in one line, while all the work/life balance in another line.\\n* We were then given 4 color dots. These were to be used as voting coins. Each person got up and went up to the glass wall, and put a sticky dot on any issue that they wanted to vote up. You could use all 4 one one issue, or distribute in any way you wanted to. HR then went and counted the votes (sticky dots) per item group. E.g. training issues might have had 2 dots, while work/life balance had 20 dots. These were tallied up in Excel, and sorted by descending amount of votes.

By authenticating that the server is valid, it can use that fact to encrypt the traffic between the two.\\n\\nSmall excerpt: \\nAuthentication and encryption are two intertwined technologies that help to insure that your data remains secure. Authentication is the process of insuring that both ends of the connection are in fact who they say they are. This applies not only to the entity trying to access a service (such as an end user) but to the entity providing the service, as well (such as a file server or Web site). Encryption helps to insure that the information within a session is not compromised. This includes not only reading the information within a data stream, but altering it, as well.\\nWhile authentication and encryption each has its own responsibilities in securing a communication session, maximum protection can only be achieved when the two are combined. For this reason, many security protocols contain both authentication and encryption specifications.\\n\\n\\nThese are few terms that we need to introduce first (again, not 100% correct, its just my version)\\n* SSL/TLS: I will be using these interchangeably. SSL is the predecessor of TLS. Both are used in browsers today. SSL and TLS run on top of TCP, and ensure the safety of the traffic.\\n* Key:  this is the signature of something. Used to verify its identity. For this discussion, we are talking about asymmetric keys, which consists of the public and private keys.\\n* Public Key: Used for verifying signatures and encryption  The public key of a site is distributed publicly. Clients use this to verify who the server is.\\n* Private Key: Used for signing and decrypting  Private keys are never distributed, and are guarded very seriously.\\n* PKI: This involves CAs, and how clients can verify certificates\\n* Public Key Cryptography: Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the associated private key. Conversely, messages signed with the private key and be verified with the public key.\\n* RSA, DSA: a Key Exchange Algorithm\\n* X.509: the standard for certificates.\\n* Certificates contain public keys, and are signed by a CA.\\n\\nSSL runs on top of TCP. This is how the protocol messages look like:\\n![](/blog/content/images/2017/10/TLS.gif)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nOk, now lets see how these things come together in the different use cases:\\n\\n#HTTPS - Browser\\nBasically, the browser (client) sends a request to a website (server). The website responds with its certificate, which contains its public key. The browser can now verify that the website is really the server, and not someone else: The client is certain that the identity of the server is authentic. They agree on a key to encrypt the data, which itself is encrypted with the servers public key.\\nThere is an element of trust. The browser trusts the CAs. So if a site says its certificate was signed by a particular CA, then once the browser verifies that fact (by checking the sites certificate was signed by the CA), it now trusts that the website is who it says it is. And that really is how SSL ensures safety: that the bank website that you are visiting is in fact the bank, and not an imposter trying to steal your credentials.\\n\\nTo get a publicly/CA signed certificate for a new website you want to host, you can go to Thawte or Verisign, and paste your CSR on the order form. Your CSR is generated on the server you want the certificate for. It will also generate an associated private key.\\nOnce the CA verifies that you own the domain, they will sign the CSR with their private key, and issue you the signed certificate. You can now import this into your web server.\\nYou can also use self-signed certificates, but browsers won't be able to verify the servers authenticity.\\n\\nMutual authentication can be used as well: where the server asks for the browsers certificate. This can be used e.g. to verify the person for access to a private site.\\n\\n#SSH\\nI needed access to an SSH server at work. The admins don't allow the use of username/passwords - only SSH keys are allowed. I generated a key pair on my local box, and sent them the public key. The public was put in the allowed-keys on the SSH server. When I SSH into that box, my SSH agent presents the private key. Thus only I can gain access to that box, but only my private key can decrypt messages sent with the public key.\\n\\n\\n#SIP TLS\\nTLS can be used to encrypt SIP messages. You can encounter SIP over TLS in two ways:\\n\\nsoftphone to a SIP server: on your softphone, you can enable TLS, usually to a different port on the SIP server. The server will need a cert (self-signed will work) and private key. The softphone and server will then negotiate and encrypt the traffic.\\nSIP trunk: In this case, you are setting up a SIP over TLS trunk between two SIP servers (perhaps MS Lync and an SBC). In this case, mutual authentication is required. For this to work, Lync and SBC need a certificates. We did not use a public CA, so we used self-signed certs. Each device generates a CSR, which gets signed by a CA. Then each device loads the cert, and the root/domain cert. During TLS negotiation, they exchange certificates, and because they are both signed by the same root, they are now authenticated. \\n\\n\\nHere are some of the funnies I have come across:\\n\\nThere are different types of certificates. From Thawte, you can buy SS123, WebServer, or code signing certs.\\nDifferent formats of certificate files: .pem, .csr, p7b, pfx. Some are text based, and some are binary.\\nCertificates have different usages: Server, Client, signing, etc\\nyou can use openssl to debug SSL issues. openSSL can act as a server or client, and can be used to negotiate and debug SSL\\nwireshark can be used to debug SSL issues. Capture some traffic, and use Decode As if it does not automatically see the SSL (if different ports are used)\\n\\nOne common misunderstanding I had was that to enable authentication between two parties, they both needed the same certificate. One needs a certificate, and the other needs the associated root/private certificate\\n\\nI found these links very usefull:\\n* http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-work\\n* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/470523/how-does-ssl-really-work/7381711#7381711\\n* http://www.albertx.mx/blog/https-handshake/\\n* http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12103/explanation-of-ssl-handshake-with-certificate\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p><a href=\"http://sourbrats.blogspot.co.za/2013/07/ssl-keys-encryption-know-just-enough-to.html\">Original post from July 2013</a></p>\n<p>I've been using the web for a while, but I've never really understood how encryption works.

And after all these years, I don't really care. I don't want\nto know how it works - I just want to know little enough to get things to work.\nThis is really just a note to myself, that I can read whenever I need to deal\nwith encryption. Because every few years I have to figure it out all over again\njust to get something to work.\nNOTE: this is not meant to be 100% technically correct. I'm going to confuse\nsome terms, and mix some stuff up. But its OK, because I don't care. I just want\nit to be sufficiently correct so that I can get the thing to work next time.\n\nI have used (or only realised I was using) encryption in these three main cases:\n1 HTTPS sites\n2 SSH keys\n3 SIP over TLS\n\nThe most important part of how SSL ensures that the traffic is safe is by\nauthentication. By authenticating that the server is valid, it can use that fact\nto encrypt the traffic between the two.\n\nSmall excerpt:\nAuthentication and encryption are two intertwined technologies that help to\ninsure that your data remains secure. Authentication is the process of insuring\nthat both ends of the connection are in fact who they say they are. This applies\nnot only to the entity trying to access a service (such as an end user) but to\nthe entity providing the service, as well (such as a file server or Web site).\nEncryption helps to insure that the information within a session is not\ncompromised. This includes not only reading the information within a data\nstream, but altering it, as well.\nWhile authentication and encryption each has its own responsibilities in\nsecuring a communication session, maximum protection can only be achieved when\nthe two are combined. For this reason, many security protocols contain both\nauthentication and encryption specifications.\n\nThese are few terms that we need to introduce first (again, not 100% correct,\nits just my version)\n\n * SSL/TLS: I will be using these interchangeably. SSL is the predecessor of\n   TLS. Both are used in browsers today. SSL and TLS run on top of TCP, and\n   ensure the safety of the traffic.\n * Key: this is the signature of something. Used to verify its identity. For\n   this discussion, we are talking about asymmetric keys, which consists of the\n   public and private keys.\n * Public Key: Used for verifying signatures and encryption The public key of a\n   site is distributed publicly. Clients use this to verify who the server is.\n * Private Key: Used for signing and decrypting Private keys are never\n   distributed, and are guarded very seriously.\n * PKI: This involves CAs, and how clients can verify certificates\n * Public Key Cryptography: Messages encrypted with the public key can only be\n   decrypted with the associated private key. Conversely, messages signed with\n   the private key and be verified with the public key.\n * RSA, DSA: a Key Exchange Algorithm\n * X.509: the standard for certificates.\n * Certificates contain public keys, and are signed by a CA.\n\nSSL runs on top of TCP. This is how the protocol messages look like:\n\n\nOk, now lets see how these things come together in the different use cases:\n\nHTTPS - Browser\nBasically, the browser (client) sends a request to a website (server). The\nwebsite responds with its certificate, which contains its public key. The\nbrowser can now verify that the website is really the server, and not someone\nelse: The client is certain that the identity of the server is authentic. They\nagree on a key to encrypt the data, which itself is encrypted with the servers\npublic key.\nThere is an element of trust. The browser trusts the CAs. So if a site says its\ncertificate was signed by a particular CA, then once the browser verifies that\nfact (by checking the sites certificate was signed by the CA), it now trusts\nthat the website is who it says it is. And that really is how SSL ensures\nsafety: that the bank website that you are visiting is in fact the bank, and not\nan imposter trying to steal your credentials.\n\nTo get a publicly/CA signed certificate for a new website you want to host, you\ncan go to Thawte or Verisign, and paste your CSR on the order form. Your CSR is\ngenerated on the server you want the certificate for. It will also generate an\nassociated private key.\nOnce the CA verifies that you own the domain, they will sign the CSR with their\nprivate key, and issue you the signed certificate. You can now import this into\nyour web server.\nYou can also use self-signed certificates, but browsers won't be able to verify\nthe servers authenticity.\n\nMutual authentication can be used as well: where the server asks for the\nbrowsers certificate. This can be used e.g. to verify the person for access to a\nprivate site.\n\nSSH\nI needed access to an SSH server at work. The admins don't allow the use of\nusername/passwords - only SSH keys are allowed. I generated a key pair on my\nlocal box, and sent them the public key. The public was put in the allowed-keys\non the SSH server. When I SSH into that box, my SSH agent presents the private\nkey. Thus only I can gain access to that box, but only my private key can\ndecrypt messages sent with the public key.\n\nSIP TLS\nTLS can be used to encrypt SIP messages. You can encounter SIP over TLS in two\nways:\n\nsoftphone to a SIP server: on your softphone, you can enable TLS, usually to a\ndifferent port on the SIP server. The server will need a cert (self-signed will\nwork) and private key. The softphone and server will then negotiate and encrypt\nthe traffic.\nSIP trunk: In this case, you are setting up a SIP over TLS trunk between two SIP\nservers (perhaps MS Lync and an SBC). In this case, mutual authentication is\nrequired. For this to work, Lync and SBC need a certificates. We did not use a\npublic CA, so we used self-signed certs. Each device generates a CSR, which gets\nsigned by a CA. Then each device loads the cert, and the root/domain cert.\nDuring TLS negotiation, they exchange certificates, and because they are both\nsigned by the same root, they are now authenticated.\n\nHere are some of the funnies I have come across:\n\nThere are different types of certificates. From Thawte, you can buy SS123,\nWebServer, or code signing certs.\nDifferent formats of certificate files: .pem, .csr, p7b, pfx. Some are text\nbased, and some are binary.\nCertificates have different usages: Server, Client, signing, etc\nyou can use openssl to debug SSL issues. openSSL can act as a server or client,\nand can be used to negotiate and debug SSL\nwireshark can be used to debug SSL issues. Capture some traffic, and use Decode\nAs if it does not automatically see the SSL (if different ports are used)\n\nOne common misunderstanding I had was that to enable authentication between two\nparties, they both needed the same certificate.

Its just the layer between between the user and hardware, but it makes all the difference.

That same piece of hardware, be it a PC, laptop, phone or tablet, is now much more usefull. For the majority of users, who are unaware of the OS, they just buy devices based on vendor, price, and functionality - and I am OK with that.

I remember the excitement upgrading to MS-DOS 6.2, which had new features (its a long time ago, so this could be incorrect) like support for bigger RAM and HDD, HDD compression, and a whole bunch of other things. I even tried out IBM's version called PC-DOS, to try out their version of HDD compression to give you more space. Then Windows 95 came out and blue never looked better. But Windows has only had a few releases, so most users got used to the same functionality, even if they upgraded their hardware.\\n\\nWhen I eventually started using Linux (Red Hat first), we got used to always upgrading to the latest applications, especially when using repo's like yum and apt. We also enjoyed reading flame wars about the difference between macro and micro kernels. When Ubuntu came out with their bi-annual release plan, we always had to look forward to two 'new' OSs per year.\\n\\nBy and large, the average user mostly used Windows. He did not even know it was an Operating System, he just knew it was 'part of the computer'. Its worth adding that there was some users who used Apple Mac products - but they were always a bit strange. And perhaps the same thing with feature phones: even though certain vendors (Nokia, Motorola, Samsung) used the same OS (Symbian), users just bought phones based on the vendor, and did not even know it ran the same OS.\\n\\nThen things changed, just after Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. When Samsung and other vendors started making Android phones, then people started buying phones based on Operating System.  Now this seemed quite strange - why would a user choose an expensive piece of hardware based on the OS? The OS is just meant to be the layer on top of the hardware! Its a bunch of drivers and kernels and stuff.\\n\\nBut perhaps this is where the real fun, innovation and features lie. People choose a phone because it has more/better apps that run on it. The majority of people cant tinker and innovate on hardware, but every developer can innovate in the software space.\\n\\nThings have matured a bit since then. For the most part, people know the difference between an iPhone and an Android. But with-in the Androids, people actually now think of buying a Samsung or an LG. They stop seeing the OS.\\n\\nSo where am I getting at? Finally the point! I think thats why I decided to buy a MacBook Pro for work use rather than a PC/Windows based laptop. OS X has some really awesome features, and a much more integrated environment. I know its the difference between owning the entire chain (like IOS) versus just the OS layer (like Android and Windows) which runs on any hardware. But still, it feels nicer when its all integrated. That is why I am quite excited about the new features of the soon-to-be released version of OS X 10.10.  It is very tightly integrated into the rest of the Apple eco-system. And this is the kicker for me:\\n\\nYou can now answer and make calls from OS X if your iPhone is connected to the same WiFi network. You can send SMS from the Mac, and transfer work between devices, and switch on the iPhone's Hotspot.\\n\\nNow I know Android is tightly integrated into the Google eco-system, and thats what I love about it. Google Maps, Gmail, G+, all synced, history across devices all synced. Brilliant.  (I'm an Android user since 2008 using a G1, if you want to check my cred). But to enable Android to share links with your PC using Chrome, you have to install Google Chrome to Phone on both PC and Android. I know there are other apps to allow the PC to control and Android, and even to send SMS and make calls from the PC. But they all require separate apps. And maybe thats my point - they should be part of the stock-standard OS.\\n\\nBut I doubt I will get an iPhone. For one,  I cant afford an expensive phone - thats why I use a budget phone.

It was young, and even for the layman,\nfairly easy to get into. You could easily build up skills, and make a name for\nyour self. Even without a degree, there are many courses, and guys (mostly) got\njobs. Our generation replaced the 'main-frame' guys - we used our Java to mock\ntheir COBOL, as we showed them Linux running on our laptops that blew their\nmind.\n\nBut after 10 years now, I can see the 'gotchas'. There is no \"science\" to IT. It\nchanges far too fast to mature. And thats the double-edged sword of IT - low\nbarrier to entry as supposed to medicine or engineering, but because it changes\nso fast, we are becoming quickly out-dated. Not because we don't have the desire\nand capability to learn and up-skill, but because we will miss the next big\nmind-shift, and we won't be fast enough to catch up. The next generation will\ntake our combined learnings as innate and obvious and basic, and will define new\narchitectures that we just won't 'GET'.\n\nThey say that Computer Science is about learning fundamentals, that can be\napplied in other areas. Degrees (Engineering, Computer Science, etc) is more\nabout learning how to learn, then learning any language or system in particular.\nIts about the basic building blocks of Operating Systems, and databases, and\nother stuff. They should be able to re-learn and re-invent themselves as systems\nand tools change. But I argue that in 20 years or less, most of those building\nblocks (data structures, CPUs, networks) will be so vastly changed, that they\nwont apply any more. They will be so far abstracted away by new languages and\nframeworks, that you wont even have to think about DNS and IP any more, it will\njust be assumed. So all those things that we are so particular about when\ndesigning systems, like High Availability, Modularity and so forth, will be\n'built-in' to the new building blocks of the future, rendering our past\nexperiences and knowledge as null and void.\n\nThe people of a few hundred years ago had to primarily worry about food and\nheat. Those were their basic building blocks of their life. Nowadays, food and\nheat are just assumed to be there. We can get it with no effort - its included\nin everything we know and see. So if a person of the past appeared in this day,\nhis complete life of experiences built around learning how to hunt, and how to\ngenerate fire, is completely useless. In the same way, as the building blocks of\nIT change, at some point, it will render past generations (us) irrelevant.\n\nI think thats the key thought: relevance! Will the skills that we have built\nnow, still be relevant in 20 years time. For a doctor and engineer, as he ages,\nhe just gets better at what he does. For guys in IT, change and time is the\nkiller.\n\nIt would be interesting to track how a doctor who qualified ten years, would\ncontinue to earn over the next fifty years, compared to an IT-skilled person.\n\nSome interesting posts I came across:\n\nhttp://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-exist-in-10-years-that-dont-exist-now-and-how-do-I-prepare-to-qualify-for-them\nhttp://www.quora.com/Will-a-degree-in-computer-science-still-be-in-demand-50+-years-from-today","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-10-28 20:15:57","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-03-31 05:38:25","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-10-28 20:17:14","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5a19eee2a0d2a200017f1bf9","uuid":"a47b1eeb-a736-41b4-a961-2e0d4ad0d058","title":"Documentation","slug":"documentation","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"[Original posts from January 2015](http://sourbrats.blogspot.co.za/2015/01/documentation.html)\\n\\nI like writing documents.

Wow....product development is hard!</p>\n</div>","amp":"43","plaintext":"Original post from March 2015\n[http://sourbrats.blogspot.co.za/2015/04/building-right-products.html]\n\nI've been doing 'product development' in various guises for a while now.\nRecently, I even have the word 'product' in my job title. It basically involves\nhelping companies develop and build new services, offerings and products, that\nthey sell to their customers. It requires understanding the market, what\ncustomers want, what they need, what they pay, what competitors offer. My\nspecific responsibility in this development cycle is the technical architecture\nof the product.\nAll in all, product development comes down to two things:\n\n 1. Build the correct products\n 2. Build products correctly\n\nThe 2nd one is where I/we normally focus. It includes the Technical\nArchitecture, and focusses on building systems that are scalable, extendable,\nflexible and performant. We know how to do these things.\n\nBut what about the 1st one: making sure you actually building what the market\nand customers want and need? This usually involves a business case - that shows\nthe need for the product, and what its returns will be. But this step (from my\nexperience) is mostly superficial - its glossed over, and does not contain\nenough market and customer research. Usually this is because this product was\npromised by someone high up, or its a me-too product, and come what may, it will\nbe developed and launched.\n\nI always hear people complain about the lack of customer and market research. In\nsome cases, if the company is really trying to be innovative, there might not be\nany research around. But in most cases, there should be data that can be\ngathered to shape the new product. I believe only a few market leaders (e.g.\nApple) exist that can invent new products, and the market will follow. I\nrecently read about MicroStrategy, that was chosen to be amongst the top 50\ncompanies in their ability to read the market. This leads to really cutting edge\nproduct development, and involves quite a large amount of risk I would imagine.\n\nWhen companies are building new products, they have a budget, and they want the\nreturns to be maximised. So they try to choose a product that will lead to the\ngreatest return, based on the investment. It might not be the most snazzy or\nflashy product, but as long as it can promise good returns, it will be a good\ninvestment. Its like a small store or shop owner: if he is thinking of what\nadditional merchandise to stock in this shop, he will choose something that is\nlikely to sell well, and that is within his budget.\n\nSo the question is how do companies gather sufficient data and requirements to\nbuild new products:\n\n * Where does requirements for products come from?\n   \n   \n * How do companies know which products to launch?\n   These might be done in using different ways, sometimes employing many\n   techniques at the same time, in different departments:\n   \n   \n * Research and Development departments - they might consider risky and future\n   based technologies and products\n   \n   \n * Incubation divisions - these might be used to venture into new markets, and\n   building completely new capabilities that the company does not have.\n   \n   \n\nI imagine that even with these there is quite a high hit-and-miss ratio. And\nbecause of changing markets and economics, things that made sense last year all\nof a sudden dont make any sense this year. Think of Mxit not being able to deal\nwith the coming of smartphones. Heck - atleast Duke Nukem Forever got released.\n\nI am still quite struck by an experience a few years ago. Two large mobile\noperators, at roughly the same time, launched a feature phone IM application.\nThey both chose the same vendor. Less than 3 years later, both products were\ndecommissioned as failures. That means both sets of operators got the research\nwrong, both went down the same path, and both failed. Clever people in both\ncompanies wrote business cases, that got approved by even more clever people.\nAnd they all got it wrong.

It needs to be\nrelevant\n\nA few years ago Google came out with Wave. I thought it was perfect. It added\nreal-time capabilites to email. Looking back, it seems to be the perfect mix\nbetween the strengths of email and IM. Sadly, they cared too much about the\ntechnical prowess of the protocol than usability.\n\nWe tried Slack a while ago, but it seems to suffer from the same weaknesses on\nIM and Telegram. There's just no way to mark a message as unread. Also, you need\nto keep on inviting people, which hampers its uptake in a large organisation. If\nthere was a way to use it in greenfields company, where you not choosing between\nemail and IM, then Slack may work.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-10-28 21:17:35","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-03-31 05:38:25","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-10-28 21:20:22","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5a19eee2a0d2a200017f1c00","uuid":"5d204804-ffa7-4abc-90f8-208fe1c48961","title":"True Millenial","slug":"true-millenial","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Some of the characteristics of [Millenials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials) (Gen Y) is:\\n\\n* Emphasis on Work-Life Balance\\n* \\\"Millennials place an emphasis on producing meaningful work, finding a creative outlet, and have a preference for immediate feedback.\\\"\\n* \\\"Millennials have too great expectations from the workplace.

These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions of more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management.\\n```\\n\\nThis touches on a theme of Relevance in the ever changing IT age, that I [wrote about here](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/10/28/relevance/) and [again here regarding Big Data](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/10/28/big-data-relevance/). \\n\\nCloud has been here for a while, and is just getting better. By cloud, I dont refer to just 'someone else's hardrive', but that rather true Cloud, where apps are prebuilt in the cloud, that auto-scales, auto-heals, and you dont have to worry about all that [Operations stuff I wrote about earlier](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/12/07/alerting-monitoring-and-dashboards/)\\nYou only worry care about your code - Cloud takes care of everything else.\\n\\nCloud has been an evolution:\\n1. **Bare Metal**: We started out with building our own infrastructure - servers, OS, storage, networking. You then installed the OS, DB and applications, and had to maintain that.\\n2. **Virtualised**: We then started to virtualise that, but you still had to build your own infrastrcuture of servers, hypervisors, storage and networking, before you get to running your OS in a VM. And you had to keep maintain, upgrade and support that stack, together with the OS, DB and app.\\n3. **Converged**: We then decided to buy pre-built Converged Infrastructure (vBlocks, Flexpods) that was the same stack as above, but pre-built in factory, which saved you a good few months of building it yourself, but then you still had to maintain and support it.\\n4. **Initial Cloud**: Perhaps then you decided to go a Cloud platform (GCP, Azure, AWS, IBM Bluemix), and create a VM there.

These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions of more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This touches on a theme of Relevance in the ever changing IT age, that I <a href=\"https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/10/28/relevance/\">wrote about here</a> and <a href=\"https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/10/28/big-data-relevance/\">again here regarding Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>Cloud has been here for a while, and is just getting better.

And you had to keep maintain, upgrade and support that stack, together with the OS, DB and app.</li>\n<li><strong>Converged</strong>: We then decided to buy pre-built Converged Infrastructure (vBlocks, Flexpods) that was the same stack as above, but pre-built in factory, which saved you a good few months of building it yourself, but then you still had to maintain and support it.</li>\n<li><strong>Initial Cloud</strong>: Perhaps then you decided to go a Cloud platform (GCP, Azure, AWS, IBM Bluemix), and create a VM there.

Will the new guy have the same mindset, work-ethic and goals as\nthe rest of the team. Its tempting to think you have the 'perfect' hire. But\nnobody is perfect. Its just like marriage - all based on social variables. The\nguy might be perfect in most stuff, but struggle with others. He might hate\nsomething, and constantly wine about it, lowering team-morale.\n\nI'm not at all suggesting we want people who all think the same way. Not at all,\nyou want diverse thinking and experience, and people who want to do things\ndifferently. But....you also dont want 'difficult' people, who are difficult for\nthe sake of being difficult. This is not the same as Proactive People\n[https://hbr.org/2017/09/managing-the-perks-and-pitfalls-of-proactive-people]\n\nInclusivity\nI included most of the team in the interviews, and let them decide who to hire.\nWhen we had a shortlist of candidates, one of Seniors guys came up with a\nscenario-based interview, in order to focus on what strengths we were looking\nfor.\n\nBad decision\nI hired 7 engineers over 2.5 years. Of those, six were the best choices anybody\ncould have made, and one, the last one, was atrocious. I made a really, really\nbad decision. It was an emotional decision, becaused one of the Seniors has just\nresigned. I made a rash decision, and paid dearly for it. We hired a complete\nmis-fit, both technically and socially.\n\nSome Learnings\nBe a bit like Google, and make the process objective and score-based. Include a\nminimum of 3 rounds, but dont go overboard like Google and make it 7 rounds, and\nonly based on data. At some point you need to hire with your heart, but if at\nany point you think this is a bad hire, then dont hire. Its far better to have \nfalse negative [http://blog.summation.net/2007/08/hiring-false-po.html]  (dont\nhire the right person), then a false positive (hire the wrong person)\n\nI also love Amazon's Leadership Principles\n[http://customerthink.com/the-14-leadership-principles-that-drive-amazon/], and\nI think more companies should be hiring like that.\n\nSome good reads:\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2557672](\tWhy Google's hiring process is\nbroken)\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1691532](Exactly.

I had been using Calibri for the last 5 years, and before that the default Times New Roman or whatever, with-out ever realising what I using.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, a few weeks ago, Calibro looked..... old. I started looking for a few new fonts, and came across [this awesome article about proxima nova](https://medium.com/readme-mic/why-proxima-nova-is-everywhere-629282c687a6)\\n\\n> This post is really a world-wind tour through the fonts. The linked articles contain all the meaty details.\\n\\n##Basics of Fonts\\n\\nI got interested in what are the basics of fonts:\\n* Most fonts are either Serif or Sans Serif. \\n* [Here](https://designshack.net/articles/typography/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts-is-one-really-better-than-the-other/) we see that Sans fonts, one of the oldests ones, have \\\"a little decorative stroke that extends from letters. It can be in the form of a tail, sharp or blunt, decorative or plain\\\", hence it being an oldy-looking font. Classical examples are Times New Roman\\n* On the other hand, Sans Serif, lack those funny extenders (hence the word \\\"sans\\\") and are cleaner, more modern looking fonts. Since 2007, Microsoft replaced [Times New Roman and Arial with Calibri](https://www.quora.com/Microsoft-Office/Why-did-Microsoft-change-the-default-font-to-Calibri), hence it being such a common font.\\n* There are more catergories of fonts, one being [geometric](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year)\\n* Of the [most recent popular fonts](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year), we see Helvetica and Proxima Nova\\n* Helvetica is actually quite old, being released in 1957, compared to Arial (1982) and Calibri (2007). Times New Roman dates back to 1932.\\n* For the history of fonts, check out the technical differences between 'typeface' and 'font'\\n* [This](http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html) is a nice listings of fonts, compatibilites and history\\n\\n[This is a really sweet and short version of the basics of typography](http://www.annenbergdl.org/tutorials/typography-basics/)\\n\\n##Influence\\n\\nConsidering how digital typefaces came about, their use was influenced by desktop computers, and specifically Operating Systems that chose certain fonts. Fonts needed to be installed on the PC to be used, and those that shipped with the OS turned out to be the ones we used.\\n\\nA lot of the digital fonts that we see have been influenced by Operating Systems and programs (Word, etc) that had default fonts, and [agreements](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/business/the-executive-computer-the-fallout-from-the-font-wars.html) beween major companies. [Steve Jobs has had a huge influence](https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/steve-jobs-the-godfather-of-fonts-as-we-know-them/), because of the classes he attended that influenced the design and fonts in the Mac.\\n\\nThe biggest influencers, atleast on desktop computing, kinda before the web age, was due to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-za/typography/about), Apple, Adobe, and their agreements on how to [store fonts](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5618/whats-the-difference-between-opentype-vs-truetype) (TrueType and OpenType)\\n\\nWhen we talk about paid vs free fonts, some were bought or licensed by these big companies, which led to its wide-spread use. Kinda similiar to how [Windows images where bought and made famous](https://petapixel.com/2017/06/28/photographers-peeved-pics-quietly-used-windows-10/).\\n\\nIn the desktop world, one the biggest issues was compatbility. So since fonts need to be either shipped ot installed in the OS, and if you had a document that used a font that was not installed on  another PC, it would then be rendered using another font. Some document types that embed the fonts, like PDF,  help to prevent this. In the mobile world, they too influenced fonts and their usage, like Android's [Roboto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto).\\n\\n##Web fonts\\n\\nThen as the Web emerged, there came the issue of [font compatibilty on web sites](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/what-are-web-fonts-and-why-are-they-important/). There are issues of browser, and desktop vs mobile compatibilty. To help solve this, there are places that hosts fonts, like Google Fonts, that can be specified in your CSS.\\n\\nThere is also a more recent way to use [System Fonts for mobile web designs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/) - the fonts that are part of the mobile UI OS, like Roboto on Android\\n\\n\\n##Costs\\n\\nA lot of fonts [are'nt free](https://blog.typekit.com/2009/06/11/when-free-fonts-arent-free/). They take years to design. You need to see which you are [allowed to use](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/free-fonts-vs-paid-fonts/), for commercial or other reasons. \\n\\n##Some technical definitions\\n\\n![fonts-tech](/blog/content/images/2018/03/fonts-tech.png)\\n\\n* [Typface vs font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface): A typeface is a set of fonts in the same family, so a font is a subset of a typeface. A font is what you use, a typeface is what you see.\\n* A font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols \\n* Fonts are stored in [files like TTF or OTF](https://medium.com/@missymeyer/the-difference-between-otf-and-ttf-files-2b77a454dfd0)\\n*  A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.\\n*  Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed\\n*  In typography, a glyph is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character. It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular typeface.\\n\\nThere are also the following techniques used to display characters or glyphs:\\n*  A bitmap font contains a grid of dots known as pixels forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. \\n*  Outline fonts (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. \\n*  Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.\\n*  A Unicode font (also known as UCS font and Unicode typeface) is a computer font (like the above 3) that contains a wide range of characters, letters, digits, glyphs, etc., which are collectively mapped into the standard Universal Character Set, derived from many different languages and scripts from around the world. Unlike most conventional computer fonts, which are specific to a particular language or legacy character encoding and contain only a small subset of the UCS characters, these fonts attempt to include many thousands of glyphs, so that they can be used as a single typeface across multilingual documents.\\n\\nI also thought I will mention the tie in to Unicode, by mentioning [this awesome article by Joel](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/), which goes over \\\"the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, and all that stuff\\\"\\n\\n\\n* For good old unaccented English letters,  we had a code for them called ASCII which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127. Space was 32, the letter “A” was 65, etc, which was stored in 7 bits.\\n* Because bytes has 8 bits, many people started using that extra bit to store their own things, which eventually got codified into the ANSI standard. \\n* Unicode was a brave effort to create a single character set that included every reasonable writing system on the planet.\\n* In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point. In Unicode, the letter A is a platonic ideal. This platonic A is different than B, and different from a, but the same as A and **A** and *A*.

Gas geysers on the other hand are almost instant heaters, in that they don't store water, rather they have flames that heats the pipes and the water passing through it. So it does not cost you anything when you not using, unlike a traditional geyser. In addition, gas is quite cheap, so you can expect some significant savings. \\nThey not perfect though, as tap mixers can affect them, and depending on the size of the gas geyser, they meant to serve a limited amount of taps. But its perfect for the kitchen, or the guest bathroom.\\n\\n#Solar power\\nSolar technology has really come a long way. Its quite common to see solar panels on roofs, mainly used for pool heaters. But they can be used inside the house as well. Solar geysers are quite common as well.\\n\\nHomes should be designed so that the roofs are conducive for solar panels, facing the correct direction, and maximising the use of the roof for panels.\\n\\n#Heat pumps\\nThis [awesome article gives a lot of details on geo-thermal heatpumps](https://hackernoon.com/the-magic-of-heat-pumps-fd2721a00586), which shows how efficient they are, by using the surrounding environment to create heat.\\n\\nMany people might ignore these efficiency solutions, because the cost model might not work out. As in, the payback period might be tool long, making it cheaper to just continue as is. What that mindset ignores, is that water, gas, oil, and coal are not  renewable sources and once they are gone, well, they gone. So even if these alternative efficiency solutions ar'nt cheaper in the short run, they make the best use of a limited supply of natural resources. Hence I'm going to ignore seawater desalination as a efficiency solutions, since that means people will ignore these solutions, because of the abundance of sea water.\\n\\nThese tips can assist you in the journey to going ['off the grid'](https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/locals-go-off-the-grid-20170809), where you are not reliant on power from the city or power provider.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/03/eco-efficiency-hse-report2016-1.png\" alt=\"eco-efficiency-hse-report2016-1\"></p>\n<p>South Africa, like the rest of the African continent, is one of the richest countries blessed with natural resources.

Some ideas to cut down on wastage could\ninclude:\n\n * Eco shower heads\n   [https://www.sustainable.co.za/water-saving/water-saving-shower-heads.html] \n   that saves water by up to 60%, or using a flow restrictor\n   [https://www.wantitall.co.za/tools/shower-flow-restrictor-30-water-saving-restrictor-head-save-energy-inner-component__b00akt8law?gclid=CjwKCAiAqIHTBRAVEiwA6TgJw2CZHITBOsci7eS9ag-vDmh48t0LdhDQQRZ_QV16_wclcu1GAboJLhoC92oQAvD_BwE] \n    in front on your existing shower head to reduce waster usage\n * A shower timer\n   [https://www.wantitall.co.za/homegarden/stop-in-time-5-minute-shower-timer-by-am-conservation__b00sbywkiw?gclid=CjwKCAiAhfzSBRBTEiwAN-ysWCgKJX2xpUtLIhDZIrEStMdYsRbHNzFc0wr43CVU8LoKM2vU72qB5BoC58cQAvD_BwE] \n    could be used to you more aware of the time you spend in the shower, and you\n   go further by using a device that will automatically switch off or reduce\n   the\n   water\n   [https://www.sustainable.co.za/gps-r30-purge-version-shower-timer-with-button-function.html] \n    after a set time.\n * Alternative options to a flushing toilet\n   [https://makewealthhistory.org/2014/05/19/five-alternatives-to-the-flushing-toilet/]\n   , for our more brave readers.\n * Set your geyser’s thermostat to 60˚C, as this will result in less power draw,\n   with no real practical effect on water temperature\n * Wash bed linen at 60˚C instead of 90˚C, and always wash a full load.\n * Fill your dishwasher, turn it off at the drying cycle, and dry the dishes by\n   hand\n\nGas geysers\nThe typical electric geysers are really old tech, that store and warm water,\npretty much like a big kettle, and account for a large portion of our power\nbills. Gas geysers on the other hand are almost instant heaters, in that they\ndon't store water, rather they have flames that heats the pipes and the water\npassing through it. So it does not cost you anything when you not using, unlike\na traditional geyser. In addition, gas is quite cheap, so you can expect some\nsignificant savings.\nThey not perfect though, as tap mixers can affect them, and depending on the\nsize of the gas geyser, they meant to serve a limited amount of taps. But its\nperfect for the kitchen, or the guest bathroom.\n\nSolar power\nSolar technology has really come a long way. Its quite common to see solar\npanels on roofs, mainly used for pool heaters. But they can be used inside the\nhouse as well. Solar geysers are quite common as well.\n\nHomes should be designed so that the roofs are conducive for solar panels,\nfacing the correct direction, and maximising the use of the roof for panels.\n\nHeat pumps\nThis awesome article gives a lot of details on geo-thermal heatpumps\n[https://hackernoon.com/the-magic-of-heat-pumps-fd2721a00586], which shows how\nefficient they are, by using the surrounding environment to create heat.\n\nMany people might ignore these efficiency solutions, because the cost model\nmight not work out. As in, the payback period might be tool long, making it\ncheaper to just continue as is. What that mindset ignores, is that water, gas,\noil, and coal are not renewable sources and once they are gone, well, they gone.\nSo even if these alternative efficiency solutions ar'nt cheaper in the short\nrun, they make the best use of a limited supply of natural resources. Hence I'm\ngoing to ignore seawater desalination as a efficiency solutions, since that\nmeans people will ignore these solutions, because of the abundance of sea water.\n\nThese tips can assist you in the journey to going 'off the grid'\n[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/locals-go-off-the-grid-20170809], where\nyou are not reliant on power from the city or power provider.\n\nThanks for reading!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-26 10:07:22","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-06-29 13:43:19","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-03-25 19:46:08","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5ab63d4ca882da0001142ddf","uuid":"04493f06-78eb-4acc-b884-bb2e203f0f28","title":"Microsoft: Cloud, OpenSource and reinventing itself","slug":"microsoft-cloud-opensource-and-re-inventing-itself","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"There are a few popular and well known cases where companies have [reinvented themselves](https://money.howstuffworks.com/10-companies-reinvented-themselves.htm), to adapt to the times and market, and stay more relevant (I've written about relevance [here](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/12/15/relevance-in-the-cloud-revolution/) and [here](https://hacksaw.co.za/blog/2017/10/28/relevance/)).

This applies to marriage, friendship, and business, where we interact with other people. \\nIn the business world, interviews test for technical ability,  culture and personality fit. You need people who have the skills to the job, but most importantly, have the right personality to fit into the team, have the right attitude, and can work around the conflict that inevtiably will occur, because we are humans, right?\\n\\nIn order to be able to do deal with differences in people, you need to know yourself, and know how you typically react. We are born with certain traits, some are gained through life experiences that have shaped us, and some are learned.

That difference drives the way that they think and build\nservices, and that dichotomy was the reason that we are not fully realising the\ninvestment in the company it bought.\n\nXerox founded PARC Innovation labs, which developed the PC and many innovations\nthat were ground breaking, but failed to capatalise on it, by ignoring it, and\nstill developing printers with out using the innovations from PCs\n\nCompetition from Japanese smaller players started to erode their markets\nSmaller OTT players, like Whatsapp, Google, etc are eating into markets where we\nshould we dominant\n\nLitigation and Anti-trust issues\nSimilar to issues we had with the regulatory fines, and in getting access to\nspectrum.\n\nCompany restructures – They too made restructures to cater for changing markets,\nbut the people and the mindset remained the same, and they kept on making the\nsame mistakes. They also hired and poached from the competition, but then there\nwas a clash of cultures and mindsets\n\nI just came across this article\n[http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/12/news/companies/carl-icahn-xerox/index.html],\nwhich says Xerox desperately needs to change:\n\nOn the other hand, our competitors are perceived to be more tech-savvy, and open\nto innovation:\nWhile we announced our IOT/M2M platform in 2015, it has still not earned\ncritical mass. Our competitors have a few thousand SIMs on their IOT platform.\nOur competitors are using AI and machine learning, and are also more developer\nfriendly – back in 2009 they had portals where devs can go and test out APIs,\nwhat we hoping to achieve now.\nOur competitors, to the best of my knowledge, have not been in any major\nre-structures and retrenchments like us. They also have a more consistent\nLeadership structure with more stable time in office.\n\nI joined here because of the huge potential to make change, and to learn and\nbring new ideas, that will hopefully be able to influence services and\ntechnology across the Group.\n\nMy suggestions:\n\n * A few years ago, the previous CTIO said “we are not a software company” –\n   which means that we could not hire developers, or doing any custom changes,\n   rather just use whatever the vendor sells us. I believe we desperately need\n   “key” in-house dev skills, that allows us to be flexible. I seen the\n   difference with working at Enterpise over the last two years, when we had our\n   own in-house developers.\n * We are too ‘corporate’ and risk averse. We need to be more ‘start-up’ and\n   agile, not working on big projects, but doing smaller projects really\n   quickly. The recent POC is a perfect example – it took only 6 weeks.\n * Instead of big projects, lets do smaller ones, starting with one OpCo, and\n   from those learnings, scale out to other OpCos\n * Similar to that, I believe big platforms, are too large to manage and scale.\n   Mostly because we are then too reliant on these large partners, and they then\n   take us for a ride.\n * Use smaller partners – local vendors and software houses in each OpCo– which\n   are more niche, focussed on what they do, and don’t promise the world like\n   big partners.\n * Issue a mandate similar to Amazons\n   [https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/]\n   , that demand that every new platform expose its capabilities as APIs.\n * Cloud first: as a rule, we should in investing in skills in Cloud\n   Infrastructure on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, IBM – and that every new\n   app/service first needs to be deployed to the Cloud, and only if it cant,\n   then only do we consider on-site hardware. I have spent the last year working\n   on AWS and Google Cloud, and I believe there is a solid business case to save\n   on costs and time to deploy on-site hardware.\n * Much more use of Open Source software, not just in side use cases, but key\n   areas like middleware, portals, big data, etc.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/04/fumblingthefuture-1.jpeg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-04-30 08:31:43","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-06-29 14:05:49","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-04-30 09:02:20","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Book review of Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer","codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b784ac96da6e20001ae0870","uuid":"ee9e0888-0414-4d0a-b525-70b2154e9f9c","title":"Some nice family hiking and biking trails","slug":"some-nice-hiking-spots","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"As a family, we sometimes go for hikes on weekends.

They each had their own terminology that defined them, even though they all served customers, but their processes and systems always catered for the structures each vertical. Banking has accounts and cards, telco has the triplets - MSISDN, IMSI and IMEI, that drove how systems were built, and the key data that always needed to be catered for. \\nIn telecoms companies, they had this huge radio and core network that made the bulk of the revenue, and they reached a point where they wanted to start building other services on that of that network. Services based on Messaging (SMS, MMS, USSD, IM), location-based services (using that huge radio network to offer unique services based on the location of the subscriber/customer, SIP and other voice services, presence, convergence - Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC), data and video (IPTV), and a whole bunch of other Value Added Services (VAS).\\nSo in order to develop these services, Telco's needed IT systems that allowed them to use the vast amount of data embedded in the mobile network that allowed them to develop, deliver, and bill for these services. Normal off the shelf (COTS) IT systems, like standard ESBs, portals, CRMs, etc, needed to understand how to idenetify a mobile customer (MSISDN), and how to speak the different protocols needed for each system (SMS, USSD, etc). Many VAS services started off like this, perhaps early 2000s, and heavy developement and customisation was needed for these COTS systems to undestand telco-specific nuances. And thats how an SDP was born: a Service Delivery Platform, that allowed Telcos to develop and deliver and service over a mobile network. It came with pre-configured drivers and integrations into the Messaging and other platforms, and allowed services to be mashed-up to form different higher levels of services. This allowed telcos to quickly design new services, with-out much developement, and respond to market needs. But telcos knew they could not think up and design all conceivable services, so they needed a way to expose mobile functionality to external companies, for them to offer new and unique services. So the SDP was the main conduit for external companies to integrate into the telcos, reach the mobile customers, and build new services. The SDP allowed the mobile network capabilites to be exposed externally to the telco, and allow other VAS and WASP operators to build their own services using mobile network functionality. This spawned the millions of services we have today, where customers can use their mobile phone to pay for services using their airtime or mobile accounts, and consume services that involve SMS and USSD and a host of other mobile services.\\n\\nI started off at a mobile operator just over 10 years ago, working on our first SDP implementation. I used to integrate into a location based system (LBS), and exposed it using Web Services to 3rd parties, allowing external companies to locate subscribers, get their consent, and bill for the whole service.\\nA few years later, we developed another SDP, and now 10 years later, I am responsible for my 3rd SDP - this time a global platform serving 300 million customers in 22 markets across Africa and the Middle East.\\n\\n#What is an SDP?\\nThere are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_delivery_platform) defintions of an SDP ([this is a particularly very good background and definition of SDP](http://alanquayle.com/2008/05/defining-soa-sdp-and-ims-and-h/)). (btw, I love [Alan Quayle's writings](http://alanquayle.com/tag/sdp/)). The TM Forum defined a Service Delivery Framework (SDF), to define and agree on common design patterns. [Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/gabriel_morgan/2007/09/28/service-delivery-platform-sdp-for-the-enterprise/) had a solution as well.\\n\\n![SDP-overview](/blog/content/images/2018/08/SDP-overview.jpg)\\n\\nThe main and common components of the SDP besides the run time, portal, etc are two things:\\n1. Service Creation Environment - where services are developed and faciliates the rapid creation of services. I suppose considering the time period that SDPs were prevalent, during the mid 2000s, there was a big link to Java, and so many SDP standards and platforms where based on Java, like [JAIN SLEE](https://developer.opencloud.com/devportal/display/OCDEV/JAIN+SLEE+is+Simple)\\nThe SCE also exposes the services to 3rd parties, predominantly using SOAP, and famously [Parlay X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlay_X) - a set of Web Services for Telecoms, now replaced by the GSMAs OneAPI - a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that exposes network capabilities over the Internet.\\n2. Network Integration and Service Orchestration Layer - this layer, normally based of an ESB or similiar, allows connectiivity to the different network elements (SMS, etc), and strings various services together. Later on, there was a big drive to base this layer off the SOA architecture.\\n\\n#So...why is SDPs dead?\\nRight, now that we understand what an SDP is, and why we needed SDPs in the first place, what is reason for claiming that they are redundant. I think its a few things:\\n* The SDPs primairy focus was on network abstraction and service creation. Its Service Creation module was all about connecting multiple network services together and creating mashups. However, not alot focus was put on *how* to expose those services, and especially, *who* to expose it to. The telco put all their energy into building the platform, and did'nt really think much about how it was going to be used. Kinda like the \\\"build it and they will come\\\" thinking, telcos used SDPs to expose their networks, but did'nt care who was the intended target? Was it developers, resellers...? This means that telcos treated everyone the same, did'nt care how the Web Service or API worked or looked, how developers discovered it, and how they signed up for it. It was very much an after thought!\\n* It was very telco specific. It meant that even if you just wanted your mobile resturant bookign app to send a confirmation SMS to subscribers, you (the developer) had to understand all the telco specific terminology, when all you really cared about was your app. \\n\\n[Alan Quayle again sums it up](http://alanquayle.com/2014/09/sdis-uplifting-event-institutions-remain-detached-reality/) here, saying:\\n* \\\"the broader scope of service innovation beyond the nebulous and to some extent discredited term SDP, so APIs, the broader concept of the services domain, the processes, partners, enterprise architecture, and relevant web-technologies could be discussed\\\"\\n* “No longer being a telco person is good enough, we all need IT and web expertise to succeed in this converged world.”\\n\\nAnd thats the main point - we cant be Telcos any longer, we need to be part of the larger eco-system. This has been driven by the increased use of Open Source in all industries, and the convergence of standards for APIs and web technologies, which means that telcos can join the rest of the world. See [T-Mobile's Un-carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un-carrier) - where they dont want to be seen as a Carrier/Telco any longer.\\n\\nPerhaps a cause, or a maybe a result of the above, is the convergence of industries.

They each had their own terminology that defined them, even though they all served customers, but their processes and systems always catered for the structures each vertical. Banking has accounts and cards, telco has the triplets - MSISDN, IMSI and IMEI, that drove how systems were built, and the key data that always needed to be catered for.<br>\nIn telecoms companies, they had this huge radio and core network that made the bulk of the revenue, and they reached a point where they wanted to start building other services on that of that network. Services based on Messaging (SMS, MMS, USSD, IM), location-based services (using that huge radio network to offer unique services based on the location of the subscriber/customer, SIP and other voice services, presence, convergence - Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC), data and video (IPTV), and a whole bunch of other Value Added Services (VAS).<br>\nSo in order to develop these services, Telco's needed IT systems that allowed them to use the vast amount of data embedded in the mobile network that allowed them to develop, deliver, and bill for these services. Normal off the shelf (COTS) IT systems, like standard ESBs, portals, CRMs, etc, needed to understand how to idenetify a mobile customer (MSISDN), and how to speak the different protocols needed for each system (SMS, USSD, etc). Many VAS services started off like this, perhaps early 2000s, and heavy developement and customisation was needed for these COTS systems to undestand telco-specific nuances. And thats how an SDP was born: a Service Delivery Platform, that allowed Telcos to develop and deliver and service over a mobile network. It came with pre-configured drivers and integrations into the Messaging and other platforms, and allowed services to be mashed-up to form different higher levels of services. This allowed telcos to quickly design new services, with-out much developement, and respond to market needs. But telcos knew they could not think up and design all conceivable services, so they needed a way to expose mobile functionality to external companies, for them to offer new and unique services. So the SDP was the main conduit for external companies to integrate into the telcos, reach the mobile customers, and build new services. The SDP allowed the mobile network capabilites to be exposed externally to the telco, and allow other VAS and WASP operators to build their own services using mobile network functionality.
